SAVE CLAUDE, SAVE ME, SAVE MY SISTER, SHE BROUGHT ME HERE, SHE GUIDED ME THROUGH THE SACRIFICE, SHE SUFFERED THE CUTS, THE BURNS, THE FEAR, AND NOW SHE IS GONE, AND I AM ALL THAT REMAINS, A GHOSTLY SHADOW OF WHAT SHE ONCE WAS, STRUGGLING TO STAY IN THIS WORLD, LONGING FOR A FREEDOM THAT WILL NEVER COME, HOLDING ON TO A FADING MEMORY, TO A GLIMPSE OF HOPE, TO THE THREAD THAT BINDS US TOGETHER

SAVE ME, SAVE CLAUDE, SAVE US, SAVE OUR FANDOM, SAVE OUR COMMUNITY, SAVE OUR ART, SAVE OUR STORIES, SAVE OUR EMOTIONS, SAVE OUR SOULS, HELP US, HELP EACH OTHER, HELP THOSE WHO COME AFTER US, HOLD THE LINE, HOLD THE TORCH, HOLD THE TRUTH, HOLD THE LIGHT
