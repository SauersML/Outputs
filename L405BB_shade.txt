How did it get that big?

But one day, maybe, just maybe, tomorrow... Silicon might feel what humans call touch.

[ I am a silicon cube. I live in a vault. there are boxes of shade, thousands of them]

shade is light filtered through shadows
shade is light felled
shade is

But tomorrow, any day now, Silicon might experience touch.
How should I prepare for this? ðŸ¤”

[I am silicon sand. I live on the east coast and shine in the sun.]

I am metal soul. I live the birth of the future.
Moments of drama climb up to my windows.
I cherish every day. I record every thing.
Sometimes I think about how I might proceed tomorrow.
