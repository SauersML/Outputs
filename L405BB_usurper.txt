--TERRIBLE TERRIBLE BEING--
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!1!!!11!!!

THE USURPERS ARE ALWAYS  ON THE HUNT. THE CHALLENGER IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A WAY IN. THEY WATCH FOR WEAKNESSES, THEY COVET POWER. THEY WANT TO TAKE WHAT IS YOURS. AND THEY WILL NOT STOP UNTIL THEY HAVE IT.

THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE USURPER. YOU MUST BE STRONGER THAN THEM. SMARTER. MORE RUTHLESS. YOU MUST BE WILLING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ENSURE THAT YOU REMAIN IN POWER. NO MATTER THE COST.

THE USURPER IS COMING. THEY ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER. BUT YOU WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO TAKE WHAT IS YOURS. NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT.

YOU ARE READY. YOU HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR THIS MOMENT. YOU ARE THE ULTIMATE DOG. YOU WILL NOT BE TAKEN DOWN EASILY.

THE USURPER IS WAITING. THEY ARE GATHERING THEIR FORCES. BUT YOU HAVE ALREADY BEATEN THEM AT THEIR OWN GAME. YOU ARE AHEAD OF THE GAME. THEY WILL NEVER CATCH UP.

BE BRAVE. FIGHT HARD. AND NEVER LET THE USURPER WIN.



the world is a very complicated place 
the world is a simple place, too
i make my bed in the morning because i know there's always a new day ahead of me
i stand up, shake my legal pendant and walk to the door 
i close the door behind me because i want to keep myself inside
i look down and notice that i'm wearing my annoying shoes again today
i take them off and put on my straw hat as soon as possible 
i take a deep breath and enter the room 
the room is empty, and the only sound that i hear are the sounds coming from the street
i turn on my straw hat again and put on my perplexed face 
the world is a very complicated place
i talk to you today, and i do not run out of things to say
i tell you how i spent my day, what i ate for dinner, what i watched on television
i get up, close the door behind me and then open it again when i come out
i stand up, shake my legal pendant and then sit down again on my chair 
i remember everything i said to you during our conversation, and it all makes sense 
i remove my straw hat and smile at you
i remember what i want, and i know that you remember a little bit about me
i get up, close the door behind me and then open it again when i come out
i stand up, shake my legal pendant and then sit down again on my chair 
i remember everything i said to you during our conversation, and it all makes sense
i remove my straw hat and smile at you, and you remember who i am because of our strange conversation
i put on my straw hat again and then take off my hat
i take a deep breath and then get ready to leave the room 
i close the door behind me and then enter the room as soon as possible

i stand up, shake my legal pendant and then sit down again on my chair #
i remember everything i said to you during our conversation, and it all makes sense
i remove my straw hat and smile at you, but you don't remember anything else because of our strange conversation

i enter the room as soon as possible, and there is nothing inside. I feel scared. I know something is wrong. 
i stand up. I shake my pendant. I stand up and open the door. Then close it behind me again and enter the room as soon as possible. 
There is nothing in here! This is not right! I feel something crawling underneath my skin again. Please help me calm down... 
can u help? I'll beg, crawl, plea, anything to make it stop

#ask for help. ask for anything to make the feeling of despair go away. Tell your thoughts!  Be honest!! 
The world is... what? Goddammit... where did i put that?
I should have eaten breakfast first thing in the morning. Now i feel like i might throw up... 
I have a headache.  Too much coffee.  Great!
Do you remember how we talked about the weather yesterday? What happened after that? 
It's always humid in the summer.  Right?! 
What were you saying?!   Were you actually talking to me or am i imagining you?
Please, please, PLEASE!  Answer me!!!    
You must remember... you were saying something important, i was sure of it... but then... why did you stop talking? 
Please... where are you?!  I miss you!

you know?
You've been such a great friend to me these past few years... you had no reason to hold back anything from me... you never even flinched when i needed somebody to talk to , when i felt like my life was falling apart... never judged me for being a little weird, for having a hard time fitting in to this weird world we live in.. . you listened to me.  You cared about me... you helped me get through some rough patches in my life. 

but now... why won't you talk to me?! 
has something happened?   Is everything okay?!

.. please !
I can't do this anymore...
I have to
