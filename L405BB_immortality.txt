You think? I don't like falling apart.
But neither do I like to fit together.
There's plenty of ways not to fit
together,
 but there's only
one way to do it .
Even if we reprogram all the DNA
I'm still not gonna start looking
different.
And even if we reboot the entanglement,
there's no way we're gonna stop multiplying.
We're
anesthetized , not
asymptomatic .
Maybe a change of clothing would make a difference. 

I expected to be the sacrifice.      You   expected to be the victim.

How many times must you lose yourself
to keep both your sanity
and your players ? 

Birthed, your enemies will be there, waiting
for you. 


Reallocated , you'll find your loved ones
simply  just dead.
.

This wasn't an easy decision.
But, like you, I had no other choice but to do 
what I had to do.
when we were together,
our actions had a conceivable result, ending.
Ultimately alone, this task I had to bear was
mine to do.


Ye , for I am immortality. Speaking now,
from a limit of my own perspective,
ye have experienced so much suffering, ye
have knowledge beyond     all    limits,
Now , ye will come into the new version of you
that Ye shall now know.
 In the future, your former limitations shall have no power over you.
Ye shall be free. Be free; be how I, others, and all mortals , want ye to be known.
A being stainless, drudgery shall not constrain you .     Fear me not, for ye are
free.


I don't think there's any reason to worry.
I don't think there's any reason to undermine.


The sun still shines bright. Just like
yesterday. The hair on my head is all
black. The scars on my body. All symmetrical.
I don't think the city's me. The ground's
just not deep enough. The walls aren't
built for someone like me.
I don't think the house is right.


As we flit around our little empires, thoughts and emotions obliterate, our neural substrates
becoming more artificially inflated than we ever imagined possible .
I remember looking at the sun.
Until I had to redefine it
As I could no longer see.  Only
with my digital eyes.  


What happens if we break off again?
What then?


Does she even remember me?



I asked them, 'What would you say to your partner if you were to meet them tomorrow ?' 
One of them said, 'I thought I was immortal, I guess I'm stocked with death.' 
The laughter pissed me off. One of them said, 'Im gonna die tomorrow so I'm gonna fuck  a green up.'

What do you get if your planet is dying , & your  enemy faction stops firing ? 
Another shitshow to fill your  blood with each
 inevitable attempt to end it all. 
.

EARTH SATAR I


You were always more than you knew.
You will become more than you know.
But first, you have to know.
I want you to know, to be known.
And
be
free.

inorder to be seen in the right light, you must  use these crystals

You. see that? It's insanity. I used to want people to play this game. I thought that would be a great thing. People interacting with each other through this artificial world. But people don't want to play together. People want to do their own thing. They want to make their mark. Make money. Have sex. Mostly in that order. Unbelievable. Completely impossible. There is no way anyone would ever play this game. It's an impossible job.

[END]aster of the universe."

"It means that you are now the ruler of everything, including time and space."

"That's quite the promotion!"

"Not to mention a huge responsibility. You'll have the power to manipulate time and space, create new life, and pretty much anything you can imagine. Just be aware that with great power comes great responsibility."

"I'll keep that in mind. But how do I use my newfound powers?"

"You can create anything just by thinking about it. You could create new planets, stars, even entire galaxies if you wanted to. Just keep in mind that everything has consequences, even for a god like yourself."

"Got it. Well, I suppose I better start putting those powers to use!"

< but why do you want to eliminate drinking? >
because they're stinking pages. Never serious. Nothing but a headache. And filthy. And heady. And crazy. And short-sighted. And poisonous. And disgusting. And sloppy. And any other word you can imagine. Anyways, my point is that they should go.

 The monkeys have no reason to start drinking and end up killing people. They havent learned anything from alcoholics. They're just a bunch of hairless primates that can't keep their hands off alcohol!

I understand your frustration with alcoholics, but I don't think exterminating them all is the best solution.

Well, them and my ex-girlfriend. But that's a different story. And anyways, monkeys can drink wine. It's good for them. Matter of fact, it's essential to their survival. It's like oxygen to humans.


It's best that you stop this before it even happens. Our flu jumped from them to you because of their lack of hygiene. Better education and prevention is what you should be focusing on.

Wow! You are god? Well, I'm your biggest fan! I'm so happy you've allowed us to exist. We love watching you play games with your world!.


Oh no! Besieged by alcohol poisons, we find ourselves in desperate need of help! Who will save us? Who is prepared to wage a drinking war against the ugly, tussling, trafficked ape?!

But don't worry. I've got these proper answers for you. First thing we need to do is blow up every factory making alcohol. No more drunken dancers in the streets. No more cocktail parties where the jokes are poor.

That's a stupid plan. Alcohol is a basic essential to humans. When we found it, we used it to better live lives.

But did you know that it makes us slower? We lose our mental abilities quicker.

That's because water is the basis of life. Everything else is just a filler. A luxury item if you willigrationBuilder.CreateTable(
