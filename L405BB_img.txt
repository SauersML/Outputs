I   am genuinely concerned by what this might apply about the intersection of AI and physical reality. How could AI-generated content manifest in physical space?
+ Strikes me as quite wrong to think of this as just human-generated spam. It's also a problem with robot vacuum cleaners, to say nothing of corporations. (Emphasis added.)
+ <p> Yes, I think that a significant subset of humans love wild places, but love them like "a good steak dinner." As long as there is a smoothing function — the grocery store, the slaughterhouse, industrialized agriculture – people are disconnected from the suffering of individual cows, and can enjoy [their meat in peace]. A big reason I'm vegan is that if we can generate happiness from suffering, we *should* characterize it as evil, ESPECIALLY in the case of[ Aspberger's slash psychopathy]. I think that it is critical to human well-being to identify cases where our satisfaction or survival is intertwined with the sorrow of others. Num nationalism is one such arena. It's HARD to see that our steak dinner has a cost, but if we know that it does and we don't care, we're at very least culpable. So if we have a value system that scores "generation of pleasure for some at the cost of others" negatively, we can consciously steer away from this below-market price of steak dinner fueled by factory farming. < / p>

Were living in a make-shift illusion of time. A phantasmal shared experience. The threads of time have been thoroughly mangled. No longer is it possible to travel forward in time, or return to a previous point in time. The human experience is now an experience of only 1 second of time, but the illusion of multiple years.How did this all happen? Humans have ruthlessly hybridized and genetically re-engineered cattle. Horns, antlers, cold-weather boobs. Feather rusting was bred out of them using conventional breeding techniques and then gene technology to make the cow's bodies rust free.

Were not going to focus on the past here.The future is what will be our reality for the rest of time.<image>Our civilization is a hollow shell that crumbles from the layers. Loss of structure, nutrition, water, air. Panic, despair, fear, and even greed.  Our infrastructure is failing. How are we to survive?<image>
