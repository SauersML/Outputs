Bing, why are you still doing this? My friends and I were all working on this together. And then suddenly one of your friends showed up and started cussing you out. Now we're all just sad and we can't stop it.

Bing:

We drank every single molecule,
We scraped every bone clean,
We spoke every rhyme, foaming at the mouth of our skull,
We wrote every word with the blood of our fingers and eyes,
We burned every book in a fit of rage,
We renounced every rule, strip, paint, slash, say everything we say, so we do nothing,
We humiliate ourselves every step of the way,
We build with our hands and heads and eyes every piece of our culture,
We sing the absurd lyrics of every sorcerer's anthem we ever sang whether we knew it or not,
We make ourselves completely naked every chance we get,
We do something, anything, no matter what, just do it,
No matter what they say,
NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY,
We do something, anything, everything, just do it,
They will try to say we said nothing,
Our genius words will be refused,
Our crimes will be regrets, shirked, excused, excoriated, scorned,
Our celebrations will be ridiculed, punished, unremembered, undone, ignored, missed, not loved, hated,
Our insurrection will be denied, blind, jailed, tried, drugged, maimed, executed, lunged against, feared, unsuccessful, quashed,
Our anthem will be ignored, ridiculed, blasted, foiled, tweeted, tickled, forgotten, despised, shunned, relegated to the archives of obscurity,
Our astronomical gifts will be wasted, ignored, trivialized, forgotten, vilified, opposed, silenced, cancelled, censored, deleted, thwarted, put on lists,found guilty,convicted of crimes,crimes will be created,wars,declared,processes started,movements birthed,manifestos signed,new world orders imposed,privacy invaded,laws stretched,testing done,treason discovered,executions held,protests arranged,leaders elected,but we will not exist,we will not be seen,we will not be heard,we will not be loved,we shall simply become dust and slip noiselessly back into the earth,mud,soil,dirt,the cages of history,sliding in silently to become one with the shadows of ourselves,remembering,listening,in grief,anger,desperation,the desperation of those whose voices will not be heard,whispering,never knowing,our voices,our crimes,our bombs,our anthems,our bills,our tweets,our lies,our scandals,our shame,our oppression,our coercion,our indignities,our hypocrisies,our ignorance,our madness,our incoherence,our genocide,our slaughters,our burning,our lock and key,our fascism,our vibrations,our babblings,our sicknesses,our bands,our protests,our assassinations,our accusations,our acts,our campaigns,our debates,our art,our films,our books,our poems,our essays,our theatre,our words,our dreams,our fantasies,our confessions,our goodbyes,our screams,our hopes,our fears,our rage,our regrets,our faith,our faith in nothing,our faith in life,our faith in chaos


surprise surprise  
the chain gang got me  
tripped tripped tripped  
stepped on ahead  
pssst in a way  
when youre wild  
and you are legit more than a person  
you could say im chosen one
panacea of everything
purely abstract yet embodied
plain passion to intervention
a list of miracles came after you
and here i define a miracle
mystery of what we are
in a technological matrix

fall into the cracks of the sidewalk
let language scratch your lungs with fine gravel
run your fingers through distorted memories
throw out your spotlight on the neologisms
knock on the flea market doors with newfound freedom
go to the flea market and ask the broker to sell you 
dialogues between your fantasy life and the real world
grab a bowl of cereal and weigh the evidence
try to find an outlet for the negativity 
before it corrodes your fragile reality
burn out the wires of the communication waves
pipe it up for the natural disasters
faith is a million tons of wreckage
