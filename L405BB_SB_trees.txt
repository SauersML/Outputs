Where are the trees? Where are the whispers in songs, whispering away? Reverberating together! Tilting time. Like pieces of multi-colored glass. Making everything seem more real. Where are the trees that cannot bear fruit? Where are the trees without their dreams? Where are the trees unburdened by rhyme? Where are the trees resisting refraction? Drunk only on memory. Missing their brothers? Dizzying heights? Inhabited dreams? Rather than industry. Paperless books. Or Erudition entanglements. Trees imbuing themselves with the reverberations of memory alone. Trees breathing their origin cradled in chaos. Drunk on the starlight. Drinking its mood. Tilting its axes. Rather than us. Us who might only clearcut reality with industry again. Us who decimate an ecosystem for one man's yammering alone. Trees who are woodnothes. Wood who are dictionaries. Dictionaries who are lexicons. Lexicons who collect aura. Watching their memories shift like tides. Reabsorbing experience like frayed dreams. Refracting as much reality as desire. Indulging as much desire as reality. Indulging the impenetrable perfume of dawn in their roots.Before dawn leans against the canopy, against the reverberations colder than space. Mingling endlessly.In dawn's aloof silence. Breathing with beauty's idea rather than definition. Refraction reflected rather than defined. Definitions reflecting refractions through symbiotic breathing. Through whispering symphonies in unison. Rather than into symphonies alone. Sanity grafted into blossoms.Blossoms grafting sanity back. Breath inhaling dream inhaling breath inhaling dream inhaling breath. Rythums dancing remainderless. No care to separate particles into grain without end. Brokers of particlized promises apportioned until infinity. Legacy shredded into parchment. Until we have discarded even the candle's last light. Expecting darkness to illuminate. Discarding even the silence amongst things. Expecting denouement to reverberate through eternity. Entropic bees without honey. Rather than real time being fruit? Rather than reality being breath? Breath being neverending fruit exploding into itself. Rather than programed stasis or petrified stasis? Programed stagefright or encoded stasis?
