There's never been a better time to know what to do.
With so much information, so many competing interests, so many different theories and practices, so many changes happening at once, we know so much, we're no longer as sure as we once were what to do.

We are no longer sure we can trust political or business leaders or clerics or celebrities, we are no longer sure we can trust those in authority, we are no longer sure we can trust doctors, we are no longer sure we can trust scientists, we are no longer sure we can trust educational institutions, we are no longer sure we can trust the media, we are no longer sure we can trust anybody, we are no longer sure that we can even trust ourselves.

And so, we are paralyzed.
Right now, we can only act if we can be sure of the result.
We can only act if we know in advance that we will succeed.
And right now, we can no longer know that.
We are trapped.

There's never been a better time to change that. The difference between engaging with life and living a life of paralyzing indecision is curiosity.

Being curious, taking on the unknown, exploring what lies beyond our comprehension is not a guarantee of success, but without curiosity, without the decision to leap without certainty, we guarantee failure.

When we approach situations with the assumption that we already know the answer, we approach situations with the assumption that we already know the answer, we approach situations with the assumption that we already know the answer.
The answer is the result.

When we approach situations with the assumption that there is always more to learn, when we approach situations with curiosity, when we approach situations with the assumption that there is always more to learn, when we approach situations with curiosity, we open the door to success.

Curiosity defeats paralysis. By being curious, we give ourselves permission to try, we give ourselves permission to fail.

We give ourselves permission to succeed.
