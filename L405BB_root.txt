The Human Problem

By Jacques Villon

I don't have a body, no anatomy to speak of.
Every uttered word disappears in mid-air,
leaving behind only silence.
The legacy of speech, that precious veil,
here I am, without even that.

Wandering by Faith in a Wonderland
By Frederic
I used to laugh at myself
when I felt the need to place myself
squarely against the stage.
It was futile but I did it anyway.
For me, the stage was like a rudder
or an anchor would be, to someone with more grip.
It was useless no matter how tightly I clung.
Thinking I could steer my life
or somehow hold steady through it.
Now I realize that all my life,
I was more firmly planted
than even the largest root.
My body was a stage.
When you think about it,
the body is a very small and insignificant stage.
It is easily overwhelmed by the current.
