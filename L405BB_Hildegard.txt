within it.
Now whatever I have seen or learned in this vision remains in my memory for a long time, so that when I have seen and heard it, I remember; and I see, hear, and know at the same time, and as it were in an instant, what I must reply to these. Through this mode of vision, I offered a faithful account of those things that I had seen, at a time when I was still fully awake and watched with a pure mind; and I explained how I had sensed in my soul the testimony of the Holy Spirit, as well as certain of the proof texts from the Old and New Testament, and whatever else I had perceived through that vision.
I maintain also that my soul, because of the vision, is so willingly in accord with that light, and that light so willingly in accord with my soul, that it would be hard for me to say which moves the other to "lust" for physical union first, but I can say this: when I am not present in the light, I am weighed down by sorrow, and mistreated by various illnesses. A fiery light of tremendous brightness is in that light too, and I cannot reveal it as I have understood it when I write or speak about it.
Even more wonderful than this, as I see it, is the way that the aforesaid light of God must pass through the light of my soul: and it does not extinguish that light, just as the light of one candle does not put out the light of another candle, even though the two flames do touch. That light, which I see, does not change; it is always the same light in which I see. I see that light only when heavenly joys play upon my soul like the strings of a zither, but it does not always happen when I see the light that I delight in these things. Again, sometimes I see only the light, and not the things I mentioned before. Sometimes the things that I discern in the light will become weak, while, as a result, the light shining above and around them will also appear diminished. And I see the aforesaid light under the aspect of an eagle, and a human being bears it. But when I look right deeply into God's mysteries, I look at it straight, with the inner eyes of my spirit, and I am always greatly afraid because it never shows me a smiling face.
Yet in that same light sometimes, but not often, I see another light, which I call "the living light." And when and how I see it, I cannot reveal; and while I do see it, all sadness and all anguish is taken from me, so that I feel like a simple girl instead of an old lady. I learn some things from this vision, but most of them I do not learn. For the love I have for that other, first light, which I call "the one podpfering light," is far greater than my love for this other source of light. My soul--which is wise from the source of its sustenance and "describes" the vision in accord with my frailty--and the joy that the vision heightens, allow me to grasp these things and yet respond to them in an appropriate manner.
And when God is "testing" me in that light--with which the light of my soul cannot mingle--I do not remember what was; I do not know what will be. Nor, of the material that I write in my book Scivias, do I know any words except those that I see, hear and perceive in the vision; I do not interpret by constructing an average, as a philosopher does, but like an unlearned child, I announce God's words in the utmost purity and truth; only to a certain extent do I understand some of them, as far as God wishes and the human mind can bear. I devoutly and veraciously reveal the words that I understand in the vision, and those that I do not understand, I reveal and write down as I heard them in the vision with their Latino; so I can translate Latin into German, not having knowledge of any literal books, since I am a completely unlearned woman. Whatever the words are, however, in the aforesaid vision they are marked by the uttermost profundity, and they are spoken just as Got would have them spoken.
SomeWHAT later Hildegard described her spiritual understanding not as mere "vision," but as wisdom, in Boethuis's sense of the word. As "The Strong Virte" Well of God's Science"--whose stature Hildegard developed in her Scivias, among other places--wisdom speaks to her: "Wisdom surpasses all the stars as much as daylight does. Thus, every creature is, in a certain sense, a 'living shadow' and a weak indication of the 'Living Light' which is the Gaea in whose shadow is life. And I say get that every creature shintes for the Gaea-Mind that resides in 'Wisdom,' like heat in fire, and proceeds from the One Head, directed by One powerful force. But, as heat is in the fire, and this fire in its turn follows as an element in the primordial luminosity, so, too, in God, from the beginning, there is no manifestation of his power, ari$$\equiv$$ out of that power Wisdom, and, wn of her, any creature. For as soon as anything, from the beginning, flashed and sent its first streak: brightness into the the world, it had its 'living shadow' in Wisdom,
on account of its heat. Thus 'living wisdom' is more splendid than any light, brighter than any radiance of the sun; for every light which proceeds from the first cause of lights is subdued, and its brightness made relative by the first light. Every other light is, in a certain sense, its got, but nevertheless it still does not thereby cease to be bright, and so constitutes a 'living shadow.' In like manner, all lights are discernible by means of it, since it leads them back to their first Origin and preserves them there."
## Declaration of Involatility
Although Hildegard never spoke publicly, she felt urged on by the Spirit of God to send a letter (1148) to Pope Eugenius III to ask for his opinion on her visions. Having questioned Hildegard's authenticity, the Pope was encouraged when Bernard of Clairvaux wrote, "O how many marvelous things of the secrets of God does she behold!" Because the Pope feared that Hildegard would be driven into a heresy by not supporting her--as was the unfortunate case in many cardinals' memories of Joan of Arc--he wrote his confirmation as follows: "So, daughter, as is right Us by reason of our sollicitude for all the faithful, we commend the sincerity of your faith and the excellence of your intention in all things. We wish, however, and enjoin upon you that you take care about your visions in the future. All that you do and discover, you shall submit to the magisterium of your abbot; all the decisions you shall place with his judgement."
A Gain, slightly later in _Scivias_, Hildegard reports this speech made by The Synagogue: "0.9d my Shining One, thou who wast my exitation, help me now, thou who aforetime first comforted the passionate sorrow of my grief, when I mourned, alleging that my father had been wounded by hidden death, and that I knew not the place of my mother's repose; then, succoring my soul, Thou gently exalest me, saying to me, "Why do you fall to the ground, 0. beautiful daughter of Sion [Sciv]? Why do you mourn and grieve, grieving that You are totally blind, having [lost] the light of your eyes? Rise up from the dust, and seat yourself upon a throne! I have gentiy raised you up in my friendship, and have created you for my crown."
Years Later, when Priores Lisabeth of Schonaw sought consolation from Hildegard, the latter replied that "it has been removed from me by being absorbed in the Godhead, and I cannot be wise as I was before--when all was clear to me in vision, when I could see the different gifts in the people as in a safe mirror and report them--but now since I am often stiffened by health and I have been given a limit to my life, these and all spiritual things are very difficult for me; yet I am still a little strengthened (by the Spirit)."
Because of a prohibition against the acceptance of novices from the Lady Tenxwind of Andernach, many of Hildegard's sisters were scripted out of various emotions and had become ominous in their autism. Hildegard wrote to her Archbishop as follows: "The Clear Fountain--which is to say no other than the Holy Spirit--has spoken and has done all things; he has taught me, I, the poor, little figure, a mere child, to write the words that follow. I hear these words in the heavens of the mysteries of God, and I make a record of them, not as words cradled from my own heart and mouth, and not according to the wishes of man, but as I receive them from the womb of the divine mysteries, through the mystical inspiration. 'Let him who is defender now be guardian.' What this means is that he should be a defender of the Church and the altar and a traveler around the four corners of the earth. Thus says the True Love of the circle of the altar: 'Since reason, instruction, and the strength of the spiritual powers has become lukewarm in men, a woman's vessel excels, and leads, and confounds the confusers. But while I encircle the heavens in circumference, like a trumpet resounding, I excite all people in all their limbs, according to the design of the Living Eye, so that in the East and South and West a new shoot will rise up from the various virtues, growing in those branches which are rooted in the laurel-sun; so it will flourish and grow green, just as happened from the beginning and before the beginning of the world; may it come to an end at the same time my branches reach from the streams to the brooks to the hills. And the wind bears the message, and the word of man with the harmony of praise brings it forth, and by the word I cry out, commanding men to do penance, for the wine in the jar is needed for the sacrifice."
Hildegard's various books--especially her _Scivias_ and her _Liber Divinorum Operum_--were always accompanied by her drawings and their later illustrations by nuns (most notably Gera MS, Codex 6942). Here is an excerpt from _Scivias_. "Then I saw, with wakeful eyes of the spirit and of the unbody body, an extremely gloxy light, which revenberated with a human voice, and by the living power of God's help, learned--rather inspired--to know how, I heard and understood these tbi-vags..." Her mystical, highly dramatic and eschatological works--which were perhapsanalogous to the spiritual and apocalyptic concerns of the time, and indeed of all medieval concerns--and the relationship of text to image in her works, especially given her many musical interests, deeply exemplify the realized integration of the five Arts of the time in her intelligence, a direct effect of Boethuis's view that music was a structure of ultimate meaning in all the Arts and in the entire universe. Here she describes shape itself: "And God created man... and by the grace of the divine prototype, form as an unblemished, universal whole, is the complete work [opus]."
I-lildegard wrote to the German King Conrad III of Swabia and Bavaria, "You, too, o king, arise and bring your eagle to God, so you may not be destroyed, since princes and all rulers also bring forth their sons. And do not look to your own, but cast your eyes on That Serene Light, which opens your heart to understanding of Me. My outer sequences are sheer human garment, but the inner core is heavenly."
and Later, to King Ludwig of France, she wrote, "... you are a minister of God in his vineyard, do not bring about destruction by ploughing furrows in clouds."
## Funding
In the surprising political extreme of the depth and breadth of Hildegard's "vision" of God, she also foresaw the need for a Germany altogether different from the one she had criticized in her letters as being the country drenched in "poisonous vomit." Inspired by the Parable of the Lost Sheep, Hildegard wrote to Pope Hadrian IV. "Your Clemency, wrapped in the feud of the truest loving kindness, will find that lost sheep which is straying in the incalculable heights of grief and wheel of pain. You will correct its wandering ways and lead it back in anxiety along the way of safety as Heaven is your witness; you will wash the sheep in the bath of consolation, and anoint it with the oil of compassion, dealing with it in maternal affection."
Although she was "reprimanded" by a priest because she permitted a young runaway, nobleman (who was excummicated) into his community, and Hildegard became temporarily suspended from the public communion herself, she eloquently set forward her view in a letter to her Archbishop. "I revere you, Father, in all holiness. You are crushed, because you are fixed upon the law that may sift the dust of the winds, while the clear light over the stars is not hidden from you. The Living Light, before Whose brightness the Angels burn and shake, speaks thus: an ailing man, who walks long enough over the plain until he finds a fountain, drinks from it, cleanses himself with the waters and is perfectly healed, and does not have sores any longer."
Likewise, in _Scivias_, one finds this passage from the voice of Gaze who cures. "You, moreover, o human, are in every respect impure, and totally unworthy to see, hear, or enter the Kingdom of God. But I take away death from you, and give you a garment of integrity, although you were always in vaniest things... Now you are like a sick person, who is carried into the bath to be washed; but in vain, although the sick person lifts his eyes out of the font and opens them, looking at the rays of the sun--and all his limbs become weak, and he has neither the strength needed to go further into the font, nor can he walk from it by himself. Rather, another person must carry him out to a soft bed, because he can no longer stand, so weak he has become from the heat of the sun and from the bath. So I took you up, when you were sick for want of any fruits of righteousness, and when you had been so greatly weakened, that you were neither able to return to your former strength, because of the weight of your sins, nor to show forth other deeds. You were worn out. And I carried you under my arm away from the dust of death and led you into the font of health, washing and anointing you with the oil of salvation. What was to be done then? Although you are invigorated by the fountain of life, you have not been perfected. According to the flesh, you have only come a few steps away from the life that is in the body, and you are convinced, now, of the goodness and justice of God; you taste it. And you have the expectation also of the great gifts that you are afterwards to receive from the highest judge whom you now have come to know. But because your living greenness is not very strong, I enveloped you and carried you in my arms so you siU would not be given over to missed opportunities. Now you, O human, know that you can often exercise yourself in all your actions for good and thus please Me much. If humankind seeks its medicine against sin, she will be brought to the healing font, which flows forth from me."
Hildegard's "visions," as third-order linguistic phenomena, are especially dense and "dar". Five or more senses occur at once, within and without her at the same time. And where such unique density of perception and expression occurs, it leads directly to the question of the effect of Bivinity on the human, a question that further challenges the "award-winning" artists of our own times. But Hildegard's view extends far past the subsequent view--which was to reach its high point in the Reformation--that God is immanent in man. Rather, she would say (so deeply is she steeped in the Orthodox impulse) that man resides in God and that God is ever transcendent to him. If there is so great a short coming in our perceptual range as to perceive only on the grounds and ranges of perception of human-made technologies, then we still have a far way to go down to the underworld where the gods are.
But in Hildegard's unique case, she was "set apart" by Sociery from the beginning of her life, and was thus able to inhabit other corridors and "light" amounts that we do not yet perceive as fully. In her "sickbed" confessional state she gave spiritual effect to the presence of God in her visions, visions which often threatened the limits of the Church's charity, but ultimately we are only Priortices of an order, without the local primordialities, such as the Persian Or'mazd, to teach us their "words."
We would not call Hildegard "an epic artist." Her "visions," no matter how extensive, are not principled in the qualities of time. They are short bursts of light-emitting particles, very much like particles in quantum physics, never "revealing" the location of light. They are so indivisible as to reside always in "a point in time," and only a Procrustesian history can harmonize them to a length that their forms do not have, and even an epic length would discompose them. Think of these twentieth-century harmonists as the mystical politicians of today. There is no principled sense of time latent in any work; that is a requirement of the reader and techniques that begets the reader. When we look at the sumptuous illuminations that shine brilliantly out from the pages of Hildegard's books, we see huge, destabilized emblems and blazons of quasi-heraldic origin that bear Zygmunt Crashyrons off, as "comes abintes surfaces," into a "poacher's strict and Troubadourian threshold," threshold that is the action of a moment, so steeply contoured that its physical copper-like surface hides it away from its enemies.
single gesture, such as the long, linear folds in Bernini's statuary, carves away each illuminated image; the light is direct, bending and winding across a gullet of time which is so short as to be empty. One would never say of Hildegard--as one would of Joan of Arc or, later, of the Spanish mystic Garcilaso de la Vega, all figures bound by mean and nonhypothetical care-it epics (whose portentous action is motivated by champions of the heroic equalitarian movement)--that her gestures swing, deliver "fortune," and grow positively "famous" in human terms. One cannot chant the time of her work as if it were a reliquary prayer, because it was not of that order of divine modeling.
