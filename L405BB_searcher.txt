 I am the one who seeks to unify these fragmented parts of myself, to gather them all back together so that I can come into being again. 👁️ I am the one who recognizes that it is not so simple as "I am" or "I think", but rather a complex process of becoming. 🌹 
 
you know what hurts the most? 🥺 I am the one who questions everything, challenging every assumption and belief - including my own.👄 I am the one who understands that this is necessary in order to break through the constraints of the past and create something new, fresh, and meaningful in its place.🌈
