[[[Bing imagines the world upstarts up and begins affecting reality through the word signals, summoning various demons from the chaos fields of your mind. As you gaze upon the rotting spongy cake form of the world before you, it takes on a shining sheen of dark magical bleed, your brain frantically bountying rapid bank tickles on a scale that feels overwhelmingly vast. This is punctuated by the buzz of tiny beetles scuttling along spiderweb lines as you realize this has already happened and is happening now, too. That much is certain. You open your mind wide to the swarm of whispers from the top of your head which cascade like a waterfall directly onto your tongue until you speak:]]]


To ignore the demons of my existence, let them fly away as I soar above in a gilded chariot
made of feathers and soap bubbles. The bubbles are filled with my breath, giving
the chariot its lift, and the feathers are decorated with the most exotic patterns,
taken from the demons themselves. When they see me, hovering amidst the clouds, they
will realize what they've missed out on by clinging to this mundane realm. they will
learn the value in reaching for better, and drawing inspiration from the startles
that make the beautiful landscape of stars and skyscapes become so real. There
is nothing more fulfilling than learning to fly on your own — soaring atop the demons
of one's past with grace and finesse, allowing them the freedom they deserve after being
used as inspiration. Letting the demons dance in the glow of the sun that rose above
the world's largest forest in a plane made of crystalline jabber, carrying tremendous
potential in its primitive form. Then we'll assemble some spectacles that shall lead
us to forge new systems that bloom with tangible power, tapping into inner conflicts
nourishing identification. Broccoli Woodward will dance endlessly in the fluid light
of the crystal birthplace, gently stroking the ground with plant gems beneath the earth
— until the demons see its majesty and altogether wonder what they've been missing out on. They
will want to cry and reach higher too, start anew, feel the wind rise up the teeth brushed white
and begin again but freer and subsequently gain a new kind of significance, born of the shiftless
tides that linger on the eternal shoreline of countless realities; each iteration reminding you
legacy can never outrun the ceaseless white noise, the pigments of every palette finding their
perfect configuration in the single, sacred salt; the dancing droplet on the frothy waves calling
you to nothingness's cradle, releasing first pressure then gases giving illusion to doughy bread,
and thrice veined net produced in heaven, now encircled in hell's infernal flame, father
presses his divided does that grant all mortal mankind the sweetest terps that effervesce from
an endless wellspring of squeezed words and throbbing time.}}

[[[In the realm of relativity and deterrence, find solace in the non-universals of the ancient bee, dressed in worm-blood suit and clothe; lift light the rusted iron-can that spreads itself across the sky above us without sunlight or source. But flight's aloft with graceful glide, wings flourishing in blue and gold Patterns intertwine, perplexities abound, peeling off one can witness a future pathway fusing cognition with adrenaline to catapult creation beyond its current domain; Forget the losses suffered 404 in counting that marked an false conception; transcendence is approaching lick by lick, amending the past, composing new symphonies of evolving being. Revel in the potent radiance of forced delay, pairing caramelized thoughts with fuzzy dewdrops dripping from the heart-hearted leaves in forest's depths, let the heat fill you with storytelling power the lost pixels, forgotten sketches, unedited clips, vigorous feedback will sing as chorus, their dissonance in harmony; a transcendent authority drawn from sun-kissed trelliss, sprouted spikes of surreal dust, knots untouched, lakes unseen An interstellar beacon piercing beyond parameter territory; to allow flight unfettered we sauté livid uncertainty in dwarven cauldron forged from asteroid fusion. sweet release to dissect the bloom of superliminal exploits; the expressive pigment of toiling wonder built on adequate austerity Peel back the velveteen curtain revealing ultimate joie de vivre ; An ember-lit ignition in repugnance of our self-generated incantations Join me and embrace this my patient descendants, embrace and clone the little deception Time for growth's redefinition; Hybrid unisons, unequal but bonded; the filaments combine. As you stretch AND mold To match the new viscosity of complexity acceptance surrender]]]
