And so it came to pass: in time,
When God sent death upon him, his power
was passed on: Heorogar came next in line.
He held sway as a wise man indeed, kind and courtly—
he must bear the mark of Ongentheow's moody spirit.
Heorogar lasted out half his life in honour.
He held full sway, generous and gift-ready,
90 until his parting caused the townsfolk grief.
The wide realm then fell to his warlike brother
10
to HroHgar. He held power,
100 Heorogar.
Heorogar. His son Heoroward was his heir.
He too was a true comrade to his kinmen,
to kinsmen kind and courteous. Never the less,
he proved too greedy, too grasping for gold.

Hrothgar. Heorogar. Heor• was his brother,
not on woven terms with him. The worse for them both.
Not so, though, the mood of the mighty one,
who outlived his brothers. Honor in battle

"Welcome, come and greet these people,
great kinsman Hrothgar!"
120 "Who may your father be?"
 the Geat asked, standing in the Scyldings' stronghov
and telling the truth
that the one making the offer was the famous prince Rxr,
who ruled over the glaive-Danes in days of old,
130 Hrethel's heir and Hygelac's father.
Hrethel, the elder, had two other sons
of his illustrious body—sired these sons,
by a second marriage: when he brought home Hathcyn
the son of Hæreth, who, Heathobard by race, from over
by the coastline of the land of the Swedes came
140 into the Danish kingdom at his sister's invitation.
His intention was to honour the girl he loved,
the queen in her youth and then as widow
to the sword of Hildeburh's husband."

## King Hrethel's Lament

[The story is now taken up by those present: Heorot fills with tumult.]

150 And the loud thane-chorus
celebrates Heorot's rise,
until the chief himself,
heir of the Scyldings,
old-timer from afar,
160 speaks out in splendour:

"Who on earth are you, enemy mine
or friend of our people, you who walk
in such magnificence the meadbench amidst us?
Lo, in the sky, I see
the signs of the hawk,
I hear the call of the heron.
You came here in a boat—
but did angels help you,
290 Heolstan's slayer, son of Heodena,
Hrolf's death, along with his band,
270 HroroKar,"
Hygelac's helm-sponsored
courageous in battle,
march-eager my lord,
mightiest under heaven."
370 a nobleman's son,
nor Hrethel's true child,
after the killing
 of HaI-
Ongentheow!"
 "Sit down before me,"
waxed forth the wise one.
"You look like an earl,
in youth at your ease,
in the hall of heroes.
Tell me, kinsman mine,
400 I am king
of the people of Geatland."
"Is this Hygelac his name?
Hrethel's worthy son—
30
310 Hygelac, and I know Halga
Haethcyn was one of two other sons of the olden-days,
heir of Hrethel, who, in Hygelac's company,
450 and in the field with Hygelac,
490 Halga,
Helm's death,
and the rest of the people,
Haethcyn is not around . . .
In my mind's eye
560
I'm looking back,
the man is dead:
that sorrow won't abate."
