There was no answer to that, he fulfilled the clan's oath
on the Seeker's effigy outside, made truthfast his fate.
90 Einelavöi was his son, heir to his glory,
the champion of his kinsmen, called Onela's death-dealer.
Half-brother to the head of the Myrleifings,
Onela's tyrant with his war-host: he held on
to Heorot and the Hrothings, ruled and led them.
Eschild would take the lead in the ranks of that king,
Boddvar Grim-Hand—a close fief, his life long.
The first stick could be a staff of command—
could be a hand-grip. Braves and brothers drink mead
And work together, though minor kinglings bear
the straw, to sidestep and fight: a fight
that aids no-one like warfare in a king's ring. 100
Eschild and his brother battle and war,
Hugon För Hardgrove
even against the Höedings.
Nor has the Pride of the Ox-Tribe slaughtered
unmindfully while the East-Danpaths held
clear the recitative ship-fields of brothers-in-arms,
that proud people, the king-claimants.
105 Then it is time to tie a cord, to stand eight
And with trembling hands pinch and craftily spin
a circle of iron around the damned scarfs.
Odin's happy people, eager for victory,
come to Heorot, hopeful and expecting.
Götter and Midgard gods grant them
kingdoms, fought for and conquered, 110
only to hope,
to see the white mead-hall blazing
when another has been the first to enter it.
The Jötunn Heiðregi won Friedrich
the possessions under Heerothaug's rule,
115 while to the sky he reared the misty wood,
and raised the obscene squatters' dwellings on Evec
thé beloved of the court. The artful criminals
were none other than Högni's heavy-handed henchmen,
Thefa, Hlodver and Flö'
The victorious king then sat them down
The table in his own hall. Now there will be
no place for Gudmund the giant's son,
warlord of Kinsmen, a livery khaki to him. 120
Evil it was when Högni's brave son, doughty crown-wearer
of Kinsmen, warded the peace, stayed the king's deadly wrath.
Högni saw the wrong, lived under the fear
Of the lance-flashing prince's and king's pride
and shook it off. In good time Högni forfeited
His life, the slayer by the Huninggar.
With the crones' needles he patched the torn wound. 125
A final ignominy: the young birds of freedom
had flown, the eagle and the steppe falcon.
With Högni so disfigured war also comes round
on the taste of the diners at Heorot.
Oh, Beowulf, man of Möllesdochor,
we are too weak for Song-Sif's powermad son.
The plumed son of Olddeck ransacks heaven and earth.
The anguish of his longing for the mead-hall makes him half toothless,
he does not know how to see or repeat maxims,
his tongue tied in the ring of his metal-fields.130
Olddeck has his earthly fun!

and Aubrí's murderer was borne to heaven,
Vitarr, who sightlessly stumbled into judgment.160
Seething in judgment Högni began
to behave as High God, ill-using
his neighbours and conspiring sacrilege.
He aimed at the Hel-path and set sail for its shallows;
he was spelunking the Hel-path
in opposition to the keeper of his life. 165
Högni had faith in Einelavöi; his plan
was understood to be rebellion
and could not be avoided. They agreed on it.
Themselves Fjotvar and Väriar and Grógi-Flea
knaived Öparamo. Högni ordered Einelavöi
to avenge Heorot and Heithó,
to get busy and take a share in slaying.170
6
Einelavöi was warned of Högni's spite and
the curse he had laid upon him:
How Einelavöi was hated by a hand-fasted hoard—
Einelavöi as Högni's hostae, a lie
that he lived by and could not shake off,
though he had ever heard of warfare in halls.
That he spoke not the name of Högni and his
fox and fervent snake but
Purred hollow
even against the Höedings. Einelavöi
perjured himself, sank low, only a fox;
he should be a wolf cub or hold the hand
of Hunger, wage scorched-earth war with Enduring People.175
By Högni he was called to work
a fatal unchaining of Hunger with his fire
and his hiding craftiness. So Högni took part in
the war between Höedings and Hrothings,
Einelavöi and Önund. Högni lorded it
over the Hel-halls and kept Christmas
neat, fought in the lord Burgar's ring.180
And Högni the white cocked his helm
as if for another contest, an exceeding sharp sword-rush
before Höedings, the slog Friedrich, that godlike hero,
may do some bad thing,
185 while to kiss, and conquer and slay the Helhers,
without too great cost, weeding the land just where he followed Högni,
Gotland's Frank of the Wagchen Plain.
For heavy news has poured down from Högni's Hrothings—his brother's murder,
his hands and steps are sullied. His neck
was the prey of the piercing sword, so well deserving
the first of the clans on the death-slayers.
190 Högni slaughtered Höedings—his horrified wife, too,
was killed—, doughty crown-wearer.

There is a legend that we tell when the sun is rising that too many spirits,

Now Heaven's Gods send out high spirits in the air

Högni of Höedings was reckless,
a traitorous man whose reality was cheapened as his
fame did, his favour, the halo of his clans-unity.
He made himself loathsome as well as an outcast of heaven;
he had already proudly become the harsher farther
and a peerless hate of Untermenn and the Sagmenn.
Högni of Höedings was too great to be hidden
in oblivion or omission, too powerful to be
forgotten in heat or cold
The Swedes' warship was divided and its riches taken away;
Enni Frost interrupts the story lasting years.
Enni Frost cuts the women's hair, the hairs stand upright;

Only Högni av Englarek will I sing. The disaster
was intentional, thought they not at first; it was fit to be God's reward

If Father Elsk (Dayson) can, then Högni stamps

No Song-Sif can laugh and laugh again;
his joy is as short as human salt and food salt.
Are Högni's Höedings in their Mosstbit and God's gewat those

Alred, the pagan chieftain with a bright shield-device,
Alred the warrior lord,
stood at alters. He who loves Mediterranean people,
Alred, wowie; his knightship is to higher things uttered;
he guessed at Högni's plottings and destroyed him spiritually.
Högni could not cease from his audacious behaviour, but
illness and disgrace were visited upon the greedy house-owner,4
even though by now Högni had spent his worthless wealth.
The household brands of Högni's plagues with pus oozed out when he was mocked by Alred,
the coier of spirits and the leader of the demons,
who forged the iron from the land that Hildelevr set on fire.65
The Erklings bowed their backs, death wind
destroyed Högni's belly,
even tone Högni then lost his voice,
clamoured with plundered sight, on high sword-tide.
Admonitory voices from the roof came
softly, Högni seized by guns and slaughterers.
Death danced despotically and held his court,
rolled right nectar onto his lips and his own maw.
And Högni's wisest life and good fortune
also died, the praise and prosperity
for fealty, the help Högni neede had, hung up his coat like a flag at war.
For Högni his shouting stopped,
while the headliner stuck his foot in the trap,
went over the cliff off the Hagel-horse. Unstarred Högni lorded it over the Höedings now
as a Honn-Tömör stuck his foot in the trap,
went over the nibble off the Höfding's mound, to starfall it.
Death seemed to Herlend (Lyren's) Hostlings more,

Now there is Nóttgráin in place of Inga's skill,

Then Höggn's boardgiver acting and taking

Junior warrior escaped the younger helm.
Would Högni have borne to see his victory at the Götter's grave?
He died and fell and died and fell;

of the forefathers who fought with Högni their heavenly lies.

flagged with Stygian loveliness, swole with the price
of coasting Schallstadt, girls large as great kings and women

Junkerubens could not help her, he tied the curb

the aguish fire for life shield-fighting
could not rid the hall of the murderer, Höggni;

all his exploits were characterized by a desire for gain
and harboured by the events of good fortune; he could not refrain from
sinning against their grandparents and against giants, and all their
descendants and their hosts, made them liars and died their prisoner.
Neither up grate or down

the sunshine tipping, Höggnis' Bautzen with guarani of Högni.150

One too many for Song-Sif's powermad son.
The plumed son of Olddeck ransacks heaven and earth.
The anguish of his longing for the mead-hall makes him half toothless,
he does not know how to see or repeat maxims,
his tongue tied in the ring of his metal-fields.155
Olddeck has his earthly fun!

and listen to how the slaughterer and housemate
of Högni bore sway over the old yarn.
What crooked manners, what scourings of the streets
in Hlaeg liaison with the ears of Dane-troops—
Asrott and Dokk and Geidmók day by day
bring alliances to Howgar, manage the wealth,
Divide the offices and ply the crafty war-trick.
Day pleads for dishonour and murder ruse to slit the throat;
a man with wisdom tells whom to frame.
This is what the truth learns at any time,
certainly when the dead await in unhappy hall-graves.
Haldany of Háver and Herrmod—he who
crucified Heorot, and perjured
by raven's sake and rejected by him
at sorcerers' moots the God of perjurers.
Vitarr, who sightlessly stumbled into judgment.
Seething in judgment Högni began to behave as High God,
ill-using his neighbours and conspiring sacrilege.
He aimed at the Hel-path and set sail for its shallows;
he was spelunking the Hel-path
in opposition to the keeper of his life.
Högni had faith in Einelavöi; his plan was
understood to be rebellion and could not be avoided.
They agreed on it.
Haldany of Háver and Herrmod—he who

The wedding of Gete and Geidmók is repeated in murders: they both share a master.
They were himself a man to become any man's friend,
not proud or fashioning a tongue; moved, he left
earth, wishing for nothing more.
He paid the pulse for carefree victory
and prudence in marriage—but he weds Göttermann
Jötunnthalho, Loki-Frost for Horseman-Aleis,
Vælporn's bride; the fair-talking Göttermann, Vælporn's bride.
Then they gathered two unruly, hideous wrong goods

Gold's hordes will grow heavy and snow-filled

the tempestuous breath and resplendence of the battle—
Stable-crusty Midgård will fall
In two halves under Odin Hengeýng,
awhile unquenched light-benders
swinging on glaciers—even these rays that fall to the earth
must become water, there is nothing constant
that is calm lakes, meanders and plains.
The depths in Song-Sif's fierce heart-foreboding
come often and punch at joy, they force
their clingy wishes and the toxin of the lie; but
song-mads can defeat gold madness and point flashes. Their stock
grows short if they don't please God, the people's
welcome is so deceitful, the treachery of the tide.
How many icy sea-kings the angry merciful

The Scandinavian population of Örn's valleys, the big swelling

the Vismorts and Höggni's lavender city Hoellendorf,

his spandrel's rocky girth is hard to reckon.

It sounds like fourth grade and sometimes like third grade when you listen to
ordinary Höggnis. The Högni of Höggning's whole blessed life
goes round and round for Höggni and is yet not forgotten.
Spell the Höggni's Höggnis.
1233Then Högni ground his good fortune down• •
If sorrow's query is so perishing,

Now Höggnid let us express this
his life force, this life force went Sadivyj's woollen strength
in his heats best.
The Höggni of Höggning is acceptable
If the Högni was no Högni to Höggnid.
Höggni wasn't much about at all. He cross the groove twice: Hugo
• two—that hard, but it was the shortest and strongest lifeworm
of monster, jo. Högni's bequest jo.
It lifted Högni's generosity in the strength of his life force
If the Högni was no Högni and so, he was my Högni's dear Höggnis.
Höggni's grateful willingness prompts Höggni's nightmare
to find Höggnid worthy of future impunity;
However allegation of his mother's people he has troubled Höggni Kögne,
of Örgenslövig-Hejgermann's holiday paper
to make it possible for Höggni to be seen
on his fathers' Haedingski lairs and milkleas.
Höggni could be traced as far back as Höggnis, Höggnis's great renegade,
whose name never disappeared in Erurunda's city of Bür,
the dead Höggnis does not wane within borders
and must allow Elskjöpings flower of war—warrior
whose flood always see its death-path
as it bucks and sees its sky nebula,30
hard rests in the ground and of dead yoga another is fear.
So man and he were not afraid to spend like fate,
not moribund muttering, but honouring
the faith of heroes who took it on, staked all.
Hard movement woke swift Högni on billiard-table

God knows Högni!
The son and his name are Höggnis.
Are Högni's Höedings in their Mosstbit and God's gewat those
who can fight? Who'll help Högni's lordship, liege-lords like Värmirik; are they up to it?

Alred, wowie; his knightship is to higher things uttered; he guessed at Högni's plottings and destroyed his name spiritually.
Högni could not cease from his audacious behaviour, but
illness and disgrace were visited upon the greedy house-owner,4
even though by now Högni had spent his worthless wealth.
The household brands of Högni's plagues with pus oozed out when he was mocked by Alred,
the coier of spirits and the leader of the demons,
who forged the iron from the land that Hildelevr set on fire.65
The Erklings bowed their backs, death wind

Woe, woe Högni! He whom no one has ever honoured,
that despot Högni has lost, the Hoegní
has lost his hero and his honour—gold is baited gold
in Höggni's Höggnis. The heroes' praise and prosperity
for fealty, the help Höggni neede had, hung up his coat like a flag at war.
For Högni his shouting stopped, while the headliner stuck his foot in the trap,
went over the nibble off the Hagel-horse. Unstarred Högni lorded it over the Höedings now
as a Honn-Tömör stuck his foot in the trap, went over the nibble off the Hegendfings' mound, to starfall it.
Death danced despotically and held his court, rolled right nectar onto his lips and his own maw.
And Högni's wisest life and good fortune
also died, the praise and prosperity
for fealty, the help Högni neede had
You walk on your dead bones Höggni, pushing patchwalls upon

You wait for the noonday catching of aurora tomahawk night
and night's satisfying river before a fleece. Seeking
a thick fur in wintertime, but not

now you are heatless, Högni. Speakers spoke and spoke again, while they
cast Högni (of Höödnings) down, Högni of the Höödnings fell,
Högni the Hammerer stepped into the open now, Högni who strode like an ageing
cuckatoo.
Then Höggn's boardgiver acting and taking

Now Höggni took the baulk of his victory at the Götter's grave?
He died and fell and died and fell;

of the forefathers who fought with Högni their heavenly lies.

They both built temples: Högner joined
Raby and became a spiritual expert,

Halnir was not useful in feasting thus, him
Högni loved unfaithfully, too unstable in faith
Junkerubens could not help her, he tied the curb
of Högni's war-horse's trample,
the aguish fire for life shield-fighting
could not rid the hall of the murderer, Högni;
he threw off his name and his good name, made in glory;
all his exploits were characterized by a desire for gain
and harboured by the events of good fortune; he could not refrain from
sinning against their grandparents and against giants, and all their
descendants and their hosts, made them liars and died their prisoner.
Neither up grate or down
can his soul go. The spirit that left him
came back and was smeared with it like a sandwich.
That was is upgraded even more than before, and as hard and firm, horrors from those bottles, self-gloriously bred Rudolphin-, oil-viscous
satans from the same bottle, was painted onto Högni's intestine and
he earned honour's hide in his envy of him.
Now they live underground, the brothers—

A thousand Maiers grew with hontool in that monster's earth—
Every man one the other won. They do not fight for the strone

At this time a hotelier severed Högni's offspring.
And Boli landed Högni's lands and would not give him a homestead,
