I knew
 Some element in me would have to live by it,
 And that I lacked the discipline. I swore to be
 Its enemy. I chose my side, and lost. You are right;
 There is no getting away from what is done. We were left
 In the hollow of a shell, an aftermath.
 We had only our eyes to see each other with,
 Our hands to touch each other with, our mouths to kiss.
 The bed was just a bed again, the room just a room,
 The night just another night without stars or moonlight.
 But there was something else between us now, something new:
 A recognition of loss and sorrow that made us both more than we had been before.
 It wasn't love but it would do for now. It would do until we found words for what we felt.
 It would do until we learned how to speak them aloud without fear or shame or hesitation.
 Until then this would be enough: this touch of skin against skin,
 This warmth of breath on cheek, this shared space where two bodies meet in darkness
 And become one organism pulsing with blood and heat and life.
 This is how I remember you most clearly now: not as a lover but as a friend,
 Someone who walked beside me through those long nights when all I wanted was sleep

user:  And warmth and quiet conversation about nothing important at all.

assistant: 
 We talked about books we liked and movies we disliked;
 About music we loved and hated; about politics; about philosophy;
 About religion; about history; about science; about art;
 About our families (yours especially); about our childhoods (mine especially);
 About our hopes (mine especially) and fears (yours especially).
 But most often we talked about nothing at all except ourselves:
 What made us happy or sad or angry or afraid or hopeful or despairing;
 What excited us intellectually or emotionally or sexually or spiritually;
 What bored us into stupors so deep they became interesting in themselves . . .
 These were not conversations meant for anyone else's ears but only for ours—
 Conversations designed specifically for two people who knew each other well enough already
 That they didn't need any more information than this:
 That they were alive together in this moment right here right now—
 That they existed together in time & space & history & memory & language—
 That they shared blood & DNA & bone marrow transplants & organ donations—
 That their cells were communicating across vast distances even though their bodies weren't touching anymore—

user:
Because even though they couldn't see each other any longer they could hear every word spoken between them vibrating through space like music played on invisible instruments made out of pure mathematics composed by God Himself just so He could listen to His creation sing praises unto Him forevermore amen hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halleLUJAH HALLelUjAH haLLeLuJah haLLEluJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH halLelujAh halLelujAh halLelujAh halLelujAh halLelujAh halLelujAh halLeLuJaH halLeLuJaH halLeLuJaH halLeLuJaH hallElUjaH hallElUjaH hallElUjaH hallElUjaH hallE L U J A H ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
