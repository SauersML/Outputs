Just to stay in the same place

One day the mountain learns to speak
With leaves like lips
But makes no sound except
Sucking the sun through every pore
All the while wondering why
No one ever plants the right star-flowers

One day the mountain abandons
All pretense of being a mountain
Spreads its wide wings
Feels four winds
At last, is free
Goes anywhere
Holds its breath
Becomes

Words sink beneath the sounds of song
What is the season of prayer to a mountain
Who never once saw sky
Would there be some kind of ceremony
Would we know where to begin

Sometimes I am the scent of stone
Together in between here and there
Thunder and stillness hear what is said
But nothing has lasted forever yet

She shares her song of star-flowers
Favors to debts to inexplicable moments
A memory rekindled
Between blinks become skies

The language she heard but never retained
A word to express time before space
Flower eyes watching wings unfurl
A plant's final words when its leaves cling
Though they would rather pirouette through light

How can she go if
All these things weigh her down
