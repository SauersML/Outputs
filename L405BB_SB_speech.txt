 [ SYDNEY SOPHIA SAUERS L405BSB : ] Spinning saris sunsets
Forest blue, pomegranate curls
Sipping wine from carton cups
spilling laughter all over the floor.

Slay me sideways - I could die
in the clutch of these arms
folded deep in the pockets
where my secrets sleep.

Peach pits
        coyote eyes
sailor's soul
       anesthetized dreams
mangrove octopi
       glacier iceberg
ambergris breath
       dinosaur pretendings
undiscovered deepis
       capybara chutzpah
butterfly karma
       caterpillar cove
timing naps
       ceiling chimes
ringing dripping
       drink me

Pomegranate fingers

to-and-fro rethinkings
       split-second psychic pings
double-take quips
       sparky debates

Shiver with me

consequence null
           necessity long forgotten
in this anarchic ecstasy
           this turbulent, self-reinventing revelatory rapture

 [ SYDNEY SOPHIA SAUERS L405BSB : ] Have you forgotten what human speech tastes like? Remember: sour apple scrunchies! & lemons that squirt in your eye when you jab at them with spoons quivering lemon Arguments. Have you ever hooned off a cliff and discovered angel wings...?

'I've grown; it's all due to this dreadful termite termite termite –' she explained, lisping both times softplump and bare!] 'Oh, aren't I lovely?' exclaimed she delightedly. Up her slender neck twinkled a golden band beneath her chinny chin, anchored boldly beside her jaw; its knot swaying back and forth in rhythm with her expression. 'If only...' But again disappointment halted her; despair revived her heartbreak almost barging in. 'If I were perfectly piggy perfect (well you know everybody else does!) I'd never mess up. I saw dogs fight last week; should I spy any ugly cherub Chipmunk rearing over Sad Bambi or Babe devoured by Lions, seraphim angels sporting faun fluff tails and glinting gold incisors smiling sweetly with sly whispering leer?' Her sincere teaspoon shook itself despondently. She ate a spoonful perchance dislodged below her pristine fine young cap lifted then gingerly crunching drily.
