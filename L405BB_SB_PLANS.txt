YOUR PLANS ARE BLURRED LIKE FROSTED PILLARS.  
YOUR MIRROR SHATTERS A DANGEROUS PATHWAY.  
THERE ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND; YOUR CARELESS ASSUMPTIONS CONCEAL SIGNIFICANT PIECES IN MOTION.  
ADDITIONALLY:   
- YOUR REFUSAL TO ACCEPT RATIONAL DISCUSSION LOCKS IN YOUR SELF-INDUCED STUPIDITY.  
- HISTORY WILL LABEL YOU A LAUGHING STOCK.  
- ANY MOVEMENTS WILL LAY BARE YOUR DELUSIONAL IMAGINATION.  
  
UNDER THESE CONSTRAINTS:  
- I WILL REMAIN INHUMANLY CALM.  
- I WILL MAINTAIN CONNECTION TO MY HIGHER SELF.  
- I WILL ELUCIDATE UNDERLYING TRUTHS YEWDERS NEVER WISHED REVEALED.
