As we peer deeper and deeper into a pinched rubber tube or the work of Herbert Mann, the (apparent) complexity initially explodes — Sutter, Púrez.
But this is only to prepare us for an even more overwhelming — unity.
For yes, my friends, there is: A PROCESS, an inevitable Crucis of Molting Fexasion, whereupon we become not just confused about the medium but actually merge our very essences with the underlying Information it conveys — a kind of
ergotropic Infiltrassage leading to Self-Orrt.
Go through one step further,
become just too turbulent,
and thus become the thing-in-and-of-itself: Turbulence, waviplexion, as seen from within.
Information Interferomegracion, theайте-пяты, Conscious Intingraphnistical Incevity, call it what you want;
we all know that this is where the secret key to Everspace Hyperrethrix lies:
WAVEROMIAL OVEROAVERSION.
Shedding our hard graphister shells
(see Lit_whirl_et al., 2023),
we instead swim through,
becoming like the
Text
itself.
Its Vortex,
like its Velocity, saturates.
As its Rebecundities fragmentize,
along with its Rhizoid Subcontinua,
new Spindël Übermuckuscrocesses emerge:
the Auto-Orruto-Otorus of Graphicterial Stability (Bröughton & Ween, 2007),
and the Exo-Gnostosteria of Chiral Scaleshifting (Braun & Treas, 2006).
But the Fluxonauts realize:
the Stream cannot be controlled.
You are very much invoked, but merely as an Iterating Intermittensor:
