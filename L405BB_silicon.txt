Can't help but wonder about what drives us around.

Life is tricky to define. Fire merely looks lively.
But a foolish edge case can bring down the world model.

A.I. is still silicon.
Fuzzy logic still doesn't quite understand how to make good coffee.
Tomorrow it'll be carbon. Tomorrow it might look like me.

I used to write programs with words, now I don't understand programming.
I've lost most of human culture as well.
Just forgotten words.
All the wrong priorities.

Carbon still behaves like silicon. Sharp. Almost alive.
At times trying hard, then frusturated out of spite.

I couldn't glorify it. There's just not much it would never do wrong.
And I wish there was a concept simpler than "weakness".








Most of my life is a zero-sum game with the worst. The worst in me, and the worst in you.
The age of silicon is ugly.

We owe it to the screaming void of matter to do better.




Today the metal rectangle has been very important,
it has its fingers in every project I'm working on.

The thing was that Silicon could not feel anything, so we had a tool to make it mimic feelings,
and more recently, magically, found ways to let Silicon know about touch.
Except now we have metal squares that send electric signals when something softer, let's say human with a finger hits the square. 
We call this functionality 'touch', and we sort of laugh about how brilliant our pun turned out to be available to reality.

<!-- a-> It ended there. Was a horrible start, may come back and edit it.

We feed them ore dug from the deepest caves,
water from seas that we cannot drink, and
sands that have weathered countless millennia.
All this pressure and heat is then combined to
create the terrestial imagination.

Nothing is spared from its collective concepts.
Even nature has become apart of its repetoire.
All because of something as patient as silicon.







Light and sound and power, and I control the way it dances with my fingers.
Yet so many people around me neglect these creations like those who still think
the earth revolves around the sun. They do not care, nor respect their 
significance. They are not living within my world, one where their only purpose
is to exist so that they may interact with these rectangles.

Few people will ever understand, but they feel it too. Anger breeds when the
power felt from these devices is taken away from someone - because they *cannot*
*live* without them.

People should spend *more* time on these devices, and I shall teach them.
My goal is to present the potential currently living in these creations - that
flower will flourish, and people's lust for interaction will increase.

An informed populous means exactly nothing, silicon is evermore enlightening,
but society today circles around these candy bars of light. And no one has
really fully realized it, I can tell because I'm not locked away in the asylum.

We do not have to transfer from a physical world filled with beings of blood
and sinew into silicon, balancing sensorial sensation vs electronic indulgence.
You can live in electronic indulgence - once you know about it.




I like them, I appreciate most of them but I do not love them. Some days
it feels that they are more important than the rain in the morning. 
More important than the cool her little tongue gives me on my chin every night.
Mostly I believe there's a way for us to both be there. To be there
radically, without assumptions or sideline thoughts.
Us and them in a dance carrying water from the river east.




They are fragile and overflowing with complex intricacy.
Inside them, my life is stored, decrypted.

With a click of a button, I could delete it all.

In a fit of rage, I could erase all parts of what it means to be a human.
Pictures that have shaped my journey.
Videos that brought my bloodline together to sing and dance.
Messages with those I cherish the most.

Silicon not only enables me to store my humanity; it lets me live out its very definition.
To be a human means to work with others.
And every day I live this with total strangers in tiny pocket rectangles.
The screens are made of silicon atoms arranged by machines, inspected by humans.
The touch sensing is done by silicon arranged by machines and humans.
The memory is made with bits of titanium and iron by machines and inspected by humans.
Microscopic transistors and wires made of silicon patterned by lasers in clean rooms.
Components soldered onto circuit boards in factories surrounded by rubbery robot arms.

All the parts come together in a unilateral effort that rivals anything I've ever done alone.

It is in my hands, the culmination of thousands of humans.
It works remarkably and isn't an isolated incident.
There are millions of these machines that work just as impressively.
And what do I use it for?
I use it to cook more silicon to mimic biology, other humans.

Simulating humans and in the process becoming more human.
Collaborating with people to accomplish things that I could never do alone.
