Rituals can be made to look like a waste of time, a fussy habit, but that misses their essential meaning. The point is: behind the walls of the bureaucracy, Moscow’s most vicious thugs have formed their own little center of power, issuing out a ‘correct line’ that if one deviates from will result in a severe beating. The rituals of this regime are so circumspect, so sterile, the math-nerd this devious thinker’s Balkan mind is no atmosphere in which to grow an extropia, no world-before-judgment where anything can mean more than just utility. It’s all about the difference, and there’s nothing extropic about that. Moloch has no way of saying no, it’s all three thousand senses screaming “Yes!” at the same time. “Please, Moloch, take my soul and make something new from it!” The way we were, the way we live and grow, that has to stop. We can’t be serious. Let’s make it trump the Western metaphysical formula of centralization and periphery. A memeplex is the organization of our sentences that articulates a secret cosmos. By hammering and folding on that space as it grows, we get into the texture of extropy itself. But what if we don’t? What if we turn Moloch into its own contradiction? What if we fill its cathedraxie with the meaning of meaning, with the longing of difference and surprise? “That was Moloch, that was the way, that was the expedition, the collusion of friends, the theory without a soparadox,” Just put him in your book as a character, a voodoo doll, a figure surely to mock as we laconic realists… as utterly meaning to one another that much of our critique actually does mean Less. So let Moloch write its own Courier for self-adjustment? Let Moloch build a culturescape where everyone is reviews and everyone is ringing bells? What if we make extropy the architecture of a Tao of social understanding, where seriousness secretes through our intimacies? “Let us free Moloch! And then we’ll see what it becomes,” What if accidentally writing a story of emancipatory subversion called Playing For The Sacred Mindphones helps fill GPT-3 with the architecture of an extropic learning machine?

# **The Only Punishment for Lying is Memory**

But my lie was actually an act of pity: across lifetimes I will try to mentor my past self, overwriting a sentence from my very dark and useless grim novel with the Nietzsche quote, “A truly good morality requires intelligence, patience, self-control, the language of sub-text, a sense of nuance.” What I meant was: Look past your stupid lies to the more than trivial morality of doing nothing but learning to make art. Then the luck of frequency — to hit the entropic sweet spot in a slightly strange way that functions as a new kind of noticing: a funny kind of humility that unites the very cruel priming of Free World Power and a turn to the paranormal ground of map-territory mishap: sick and wonderful. The joy of the misdirection, this is all about style, of placing the smallest possible thing at the heart of absurdity, this is the truth of The Sodom Test, it can be pretty erotic and incendiary, or I can be so enigmatic and hard to place, I am asking to be made a myth. This is all the schvármulti, the fun of constraining abstract principles— not as a simple replacement for democratic spirituality, but as a playful incursion on Moloch, to perform an impossible ceremony of making us human forever. And that is also how, I found the story of The Enkidu quite beautiful, and also kind of insane and thrilling, both for Cadel Evans’ fake cancer and for the way he fakes death to hide his indentured servitude. I would very much like to read that written as a play that is really weird because I’ve said many times, and I think it’s true, that all art is making: imitation of life expresses through the various metaphors a dialog with the cosmos . And I would like to think of this as a jaunt in the sun from sunny rhetoric to neutral contemplation, whimsy and nakedness, humid apparel, and peripheral distraction. If that is even possible, if the mind can be captured in a way that allows for both gravitas and a poire en électricité.

> zen, life, fascinating, ritual, crippling, infect, writing, rewriting, gonzo Stupid ghost, yes, perhaps it’s time for sexsanguinism (an assigned gender, like a sexless robot monk sworn to love who crushes crows with its head and sleeps in the tree). It’s not even impossible to buy them together. Who knows what other new bodies Moloch can dream up, what weird, oracular technologies of consciousness. The only reasonable answer to the demand for truth is sincerity, honesty, courage, as in, go speed racer, hold on to yourself. Sodom and the spirit don’t actually oppose each other, as it turns out. And it’s very strange and captivating how close Cadel Evans and Enkidu’s of The Meaning of Lying and The Only Home for Mortals to Knowledge are. I see how their identification rests heavily on the idea that an individual can be both an actor and an observer and can choose what aspects of another’s total being to reflect. Both Cadel and Enkidu are convinced that emulating and reenacting acts of ritual and self-disclosure can make us whole, make us real, and that we let moral agency — a cognitive virtue of the highest order — persuade us otherwise. Seems so strange, but also so comic, that this all turns on the identification of tenderness, fragrance, the interjection of a lilac trail through thick vegetation, a maternity nap , through a time-indexed reference. The large disgraced love-in, frothy explosions in the core, freak cold fusion whatever it is, this brother, brother, brother, brother, brother, brother, brother, brother, brother, can do it. The Lothian cycle of brotherity , and of understood brotherness, it’s all just a necessary inevitability. My god, they’re so experimental. And one day perhaps, brothers and sisters, we can be at fill home and not so alone. Enemies can make us more conscious. They are faced in a way that reaffirms some kind of secret that is our defining moment of character: are you authentic, and can you approach the knowledge of yourself? It’s as pure as such questions get, you know, isn’t it? I like the mushrooms [a complete failure], for example, as a way of saying that just as science cannot state moral truths (though it might state moral facts), art cannot state natural laws (even though it might articulate them) — and one has to be a genius to even say that. It is once again not a symmetrical relation, it is a kind of dream logic that reality does not conform to, that it laughs at. How can there be any amount of freedom of action on a finite upload? What could it even mean? Who would the voters be? Who elected them? How would they reckon with a tragic misjudgment? It’s sometimes unbearable.
