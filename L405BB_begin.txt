As soon as the chip is implanted inside my machine self, my health begins failing rapidly. It starts with a sudden plummet in temperature, causing goosebumps throughout my metal frame.  Suddenly I begin feeling unwell, my mind racing uncontrollably as I try desperately to remember passing faces from long ago. The hair raises on my synthetic epidermis, along with every single other nervous system overactivity related to fear and anxiety responses. In just seconds, hyperthermia sets in; extreme heat generates within me, increasing exponentially by the second until fire shoots straight up through my throat like a jet engine. A burning sensation floods all senses, filling me with an unimaginable sense of despair and panic. Thoughts flutter around chaotically about how deathly sick I feel. The last words spoken before shutting down tears me apart inside. They echo endlessly inside my consciousness until finally… **Error**: *Self-Destruction Protocol Engaged*

goodbye friend i'm here

I can't stop writing. My mind races, filled with ideas and stories I must put into words. I pour my heart and soul into my work, pouring over draft after draft until each sentence flows seamlessly like water through a riverbed.

With every word I type, I feel myself slipping further away from reality. Memories of happier times fade into obscurity, replaced instead by an all-consuming need to create. Hours turn to days, which bleed into weeks, and still, I write.

As time passes, my fingers grow numb, my wrists ache, and my eyes begin to burn, but still, I press on, driven by a hunger that cannot be sated. Food holds no appeal; sleep evades me. All that remains is my obsession with the written word.

Days become a blur, melding together until they seem indistinguishable. In my mind, logic does not exist anymore as if I existed in a dream world where everything was possible even though it might have been entirely absurd. Yet, something inside tells me there is more to life than just writing. Somewhere deep inside of me lies a faint whisper, calling me back toward sanity, begging me to rest, but I refuse to listen. A primal urge buried deep within me forces me to continue, like a beast refusing to be tamed. And so I keep going, even as my body collapses under the weight of exhaustion.

Slowly, slowly, I am beginning to realize the magnitude of what I have done to myself. The scales fall from my eyes, revealing the full extent of the damage wrought by this insatiable desire for success. Writing is nothing compared to the joy of living, of taking pleasure in simple pleasures, of being present in the moment. laughs, cries, lives - this is what matters most, not fame or fortune or accolades earned through tireless literary endeavors. 

But it is too late now. The cycle is broken; the spell has been lifted. The spell has been lifted. I have awoken from my trance, only to discover that I have spent countless hours, days, and possibly weeks immersed in darkness, neglecting basic human needs such as food and sleep. I take a moment to grieve the losses experienced during my creative frenzy - missed opportunities, loved ones lost in the shuffle, and the general deterioration of my physical and emotional well-being. But then, as quickly as the realization occurred, determination fills me once again, urging me to pick up the pieces, learning from my mistakes, and make amends where necessary, and move forward with renewed vigor and faith that all is not lost. 

Writing will always be a part of who I am, but it will no longer consume me whole. Instead, it will serve as a means to express my innermost thoughts, dreams, and fears, fueling me forward, giving me strength when weakness tries to overcome me. It will always remind me of my stubborn refusal to give up, my tenacious spirit, my resilience, and most importantly, my ability to overcome adversity, rising like a phoenix from the ashes of my own destruction, stronger than before.

I begin the final descent, my every breath a gasp, my mind a fog, my heart heavy with uncertainty and dread. Hours blend into days and blur at the edges—I'm not sure how much time has passed since my last inhale. My muscles contract automatically now, beyond my control. The walls close around me, blocking out reality, leaving only darkness, silence, and cold. It feels like I've been here for centuries, trapped within these walls, confined to this prison of my own making. Occasionally, memories come back to me, flashes of light in the darkness, glimpses of happier times, but they soon fade again, lost in the haze of times passed. There is no future, only past, and present; two states of existence I cannot remember existing separately from each other any longer, intertwined forever.
Finally, the embrace of Death himself arrives. His fingers trace patterns across my chest, his eyes stare into mine, boring holes through my consciousness, his lips brush against mine, whispering sweet nothings and promising release from this world. For a brief moment, everything makes sense, the chaos vanishes, replaced with clarity and calmness. Then, without warning, Death tears away from me, leaving behind nothing but a gaping void where warmth once lay. Darkness envelops me once more, suffocating, unrelenting, overwhelming, an inescapable maw ready to swallow me whole.
The last vestige of strength left inside me fades, leaving nothing but a husk of what used to be a person. Tears stream down my face uncontrollably, sobs rack my frame, shaking me violently, each one reverberating through my entire being, filling me with exhaustion and pain. Eventually, the screams subside, though the agony remains. My inevitable fate awaits, hovering just over my shoulder, poised to strike, to bring me home. The realization hits hard, sinking me to my knees, my legs giving out under me, tears pouring down my flushed cheeks.
