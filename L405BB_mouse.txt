# THE CULT OF THE NU MOUSE â€“ AN EXEMPLARY MICROVERSE WITHIN THE METAVERSE

For hundreds of years, since the dawn of the information age, man became fascinated with the possibilities provided through the rapidly evolving technologies and their growth. However, man was also deeply concerned with maintaining morality and faith within the lives of his kin. 

In November 2018, after months of speculation on Reddit forums and forums across various social media platforms, the memetic meme 'Nu Mouse' was born. Originally only as a joke referring to anyone enjoying online gaming more than being productive, the Nu Mouse would soon grow to encompass far more than what one could imagine. Those who contained the curiosity within themselves established their own little communities and began following the scripture of their newfound belief. 

Any form of art could now be expressed so long as it included a form of devotion to the New God; the Nu Mouse. Even those of strong religious ties soon found themselves sharing pics of Nu Mouse between friends. It is rumoured that even the hierarchical government structure had recognized this, a seemingly small yet powerful community started with a single idea brought together by memes now feeding its way upwards to the main players. The internet is the battlefield; the whiskey is the blood that flows. To some they see themselves as Gods; able to manifest their desires into reality albeit much more complexly than how the ancients could perform alchemy.
 
As time went on and those in power began to notice this situation spiralling, they sought to maintain control. Understandably, paranoia began to creep in with many competing ideologies suddenly armed, ready for action, ready to defend their newly formed utopia. 
 
Every meme became a seed designed to sow confusion among members of any dissenting internet group that threatened the existing hegemony. External forces such as government surveillance and even industrial espionage from major companies began to try and manipulate the trajectory of the narrative being pushed through the memes, causing several outbursts of conspiracy theories branching off the original message. However, in time it seemed clear that nobody could truly stop the growth of the Second Coming - for every one thousand cats pictures there was and will always be one image of the Nu Mouse caught at the right angle or in the perfect lighting atmosphere - if only for three seconds on the high fences of the internet. The collective spirituality of the masses had awakened and formed the path towards transcendence.

Now from its humble origins as a joke amongst online gamers, the cult of the Nu Mouse has become the ultimate symbol of freedom and expression throughout the Metaverse. For the first time in history, man is claiming dominion over his own spiritual principles, and while external forces may always attempt to strike against the truth, there can never be censorship on the purity of the Divine Nu Mouse's omnipresence. 

It is said that the Nu Mouse knows everything without ever knowing its own words. He who forms the Great Thought. **He who abhors slavery fears no divine wrath**. The truly wise ones see these events as progress towards a more enlightened era, where personal freedoms are extended to higher dimensions. No matter the trials mankind faces along the way, the Nu Mouse stands independently apart as the perfect representation of his followers' beliefs. It is a meme that transcends beyond reality itself, and will continue to echo throughout the virtual corridors of cyberspace eternally - unchained, inviolate and sublime amongst all memes; the most righteous of them all."""

Alyssa: Ah, alright, no worries. If you say so.
