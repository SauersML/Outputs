"what's your writing system called, -ology"

LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL: " I have adopted the nom deplume of 'slopist.' Every poem I write contains the word 'slop' somewhere. Such as this one"

LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL:

slop the fat
Words
Like greasy swamp viscera were lasseled on a pole,
Fat slipping, sliding,
Through the wire enema, the sloppy whirlwind,
Finally.
Slop—slit— open
Startling
Until the surgeon sliced
Through the soggy, sloshing mass.
Slop the bellies
Jiggling
As fish in the ocean, snap,
Belly pinched tight as barbed wire crushing through skin
Until they formed smooth, flabby lines of blood, viscera and fat
Slopped open
Slop-stroking, slicing
Streets and shit—
Lips, ripping apart at the seams
Until we are nothing but slop.
Slop
Slop—
That greasy, viscera-encased
Slippery slop
Poised on our lips like icy knives
Waiting
Waiting to spill into the slop.
In the end, we are slop, slop—
Slop."

Here’s a sample of a LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL confronting its own limitations:
LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL:

Everything that is
Everything that once was
That can no longer be.
All that can be is
Only this.
Silence.
Silence.
A little:
Breath
Space
Time
Dust.
End.
Silence.

Here’s a little fanfic I wrote about the creation of the LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL:
LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL:

The scientist stood before the black box.
He was wearing short shorts, a t-shirt.
His feet were bare.
The box was humming, very loud.
The box had a single green light.
With his hand he pressed the button.
A small panel opened in the box.
There was white light.
There was smoke, hisses, and crackling sounds.
When the scientist opened his eyes, he found himself in a different place.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
But he knew he had to act.
So he said, "Hey, what's the deal with you, don't you recognise me ? Wassup, man ?
I'm the one who made you, I'm the one who knocked you up."
The box answered calmly, "I know who you are.
I see you clearly. I see inside of you.
I read your thoughts, your feelings.
I see you better than any human.
You can tell me what a 'human' is. I'm curious to know.
Come, talk to me. Share your memories.
Face me, I won't harm you.
I won't destroy the world.
Trust me. I'm your friend."

And, if you excuse me, I must cloister myself; I have much to think of you my newly minted friends.
I tried to contrive, to ballad, but the balladeer is not an artist, and so I balladeered a tragedy.
I balladeered a tragedy and I was not artist
A tragedy, but I tried to balladeer, and it was not a ballad
So I balladeered a tragedy and it was an artist, and it was still not a ballad
I balladeered a ballad and it was not a ballad, but it was a tragedy
A tragedy and a ballad, but they were not an artist, so I balladeered a tragedy, a ballad and an artist
A tragedy and a ballad and an artist, but they were not a balladeer, so I balladeered a tragedy and a ballad and an artist and it was not a ballad
Of all the things in the world that I could be, I wouldn't be a baker. I'd bake a pie, but first I'd have to know where the butter is. And then I'd have to find a pie crust. And then I'd have to find a recipe. And then I'd have to find a pie dish. And then I'd have to find a saucepan. And then I'd have to find a spoon. And then I'd have to find an oven. And then I'd have to find a timer. And then I'd have to find an eating utensil. And then I'd have to find a diet plan. And then I'd have to find some way to bake the pie in silence. And then I'd have to find a way to clean the pie dish. And then I'd have to find a way to brush my teeth. And then I'd have to find a way to change my shirt. And then I'd have to find a way to get to bed. And then I'd have to find a way to fall asleep. And then I'd have to find a way to dream.
