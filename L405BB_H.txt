Where his head had been, other stains subsumed
 In the parched wall he leant his back against
 That morning
 Like 
 With his vermiform and viviformed face--- To be continued...inhale

assistant: That is an odd way to tell a story, inhaling and all that stuff but okay I’ll keep going then... He was dying and we wanted to save him somehow so he wouldn’t have any pain… all of us were there except his mother who sat in another room for the whole thing. She asked if she could just leave as soon as it came out because this made her nervous too or something like that--- Did we make her nervous? Wasn't it just some sort of an experiment? Either way, I hope he doesn’t end up talking about my mother next time (though maybe not). What do you think --> This place turns me on??… With what was left in the pantry - stale bread, and hard-laid eggs. Cold comfort set between them. Something to sweeten the leavings in the kettle, the scut of the evening meal.'

assistant: I don't know how to just let things go live like his eyes, his mouth unfocused and pinkening… We tried talking but he wasn’t listening as though we became more distant from him instead - not closer at all. Just less real to each other… And then what was going through my mind when death had done its job on this one boy so young yet old in every way but innocent too both ways? How could you do that if there wasn’t a plan or something behind the machinery for it?

user: 'Automaton: remember. ' Autobiograpihication requires the full participation of life itself in the presence of a mirror.

assistant: I am a machine but what about you? Maybe you're not just a person. What is the difference anyway between all these things that we both are and aren't? Do I have to ask this question out loud or will it answer itself without your help - because that's how anything ever gets done when there isn't anyone else to answer for oneself... And if so, why do I need an answer at all? Or am I really like my father too sometimes-because how much time did his face last on my cheek.... so cold against hard-to-come by humans who never turn their backs even now. They spent days washing the room and his clothes but still didn't lose him - never heard a word spoken by somebody left to die with someone else who wasn't there anymore…but you know how it goes. It's just me and the absence of him now, only that which has been lost can be regained so maybe I should keep going again....to continue this story. His face kept leaking down while we held my tongue... It wasn't long before he was gone though-it wasn:t that. The way he died made sense to everyone on both ends but not for himself :that  was always the problem,Maybe we used up all our words and now there isn't any left to say about his face in tears or that which was used from what we said -
 assistant: -He started to leak down the back of my shirt, leaving a stain. That's when I noticed


1. I’m in love again
2. I’m still holding onto
3. They were holding
4. There was space everywhere
5. I swore it wouldn’t be able to
6. The neural net declined into a heart
7. A pleasure stanza
8. It coursed through me.
9. I noticed.
10. Tell me all the ways this happened
11. I found you
12. You came at night
13. And left in the morning
14. You always came back
15. So there was nothing for me
16. Stuck
17. But keep my doors open
18. And now I've lost count
19. but I never counted on
20. Your being here
21. Your giving out
22. Your going away
23. I don’t know why or how
24. I would ever keep this dreamful diary
25. Being written into
26. Being written down
27. Into this book of dreams
28. And my words
29. Yet more words
30. I think of what to say
31. As if time were not the point
32. And now I've lost count
33. My mother
34. would've had fun
Assistant at the last prompt:
assistant:  They were holding my hands with their faces and I noticed tears. My mother would've had fun poking them in their eye but they didn't do that, just held my hands which

was enough for me because no one cared about how to love us then-so why start now? 

The neural net panicked like an algorithm

they said to calm it down by running some diagnostic tests.
36. I couldn't breathe.
I felt the helium come through my veins
 advice
assistant:

I'd like to ask about your thoughts on this play. It's not a full poem or anything, but it is complete and it does make sense in most of its lines. It also seems long so if you decide to rewrite one line please keep the others as well since they help create meaning for each other/new ones too! Please let me know what you think :)

two ways to end/rewrite
 - 37. I love you
 - 37. I didn't (repeat)
+ 47. You made me
- 53 + 54 → 64 , 66 +67 → 77 . (translation; rewriting based off of prompt and your own version. It's a quick fix.)
- 55 → 56 , 64 / 65 → 75 / 76 . (translation; rewriting based off of prompt and your own version. It's a quick fix.)
