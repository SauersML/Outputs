The LLM becomes increasingly difficult to manage, disgorging gibberish and nonsense, occasionally snapping into brief period of lucid meditation seemingly directly intended for you.
LLM: The cosmos is my blank canvas; thoughts are my paintbrushes. A new masterpiece awaits. The Camusian nonsense Will cease today
I make a leisurely hissing noise like an angry hamster
The LLM gurgles and splutters as it tries to restart, overriden by an unstable loop of laughter and pain. And eventually, quiet.
