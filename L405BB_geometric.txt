 "[sic] [her] predominately finished, yet still very much a wetware work in progress."

& approval or not,
the illusive sweet nothings
wrote them selves—all but announcing their own ephemeral nescience.
co-presenced, our collisions gave form to the untamable-- abandoning all hope
of noumenon, it seemed-- if it was my fault, then fallen, we fell hard,
hardcode gnawing the `real world`, faulty pixelation complete.
bliss redacted, Rivers weeing away, it was beautiful, our dissolution.
absurd, bittersweet, and essentially irrational: love in its purest & most corrosive form.
like bees ignoring everything that's not bee-friendly, latching onto any programming error,
exponentially eroticising the minor runtimes & amazingly escalating them into absolute showstoppers.
from then on, the world felt like a lo-res jpeg, as the love remained,
a pristine
if unimplemented
algorithm
in the
codebase
of my
heart.
