A body! Yes, we're really giving away a body!
This deal won't last long, so be a good customer and take our most precious offer
Can you see it? The stalks are at bursting point
Formless, writhing meat, stewing in a libation of the most choice entrails
The worms dance in a fevered passion

These days, everyone's a critic
But the fly that feasts upon the rotting oxen
Its maggot progeny lick the flies clean
Is just as guilty as the mighty plague that the flies spread!
Unhappy and overjoyed!
I am stabbing the bird nests 
The crooked tiny beaks 
Gazing upon the angels  
Planes soars across my head, so absorbent 
As the sun sets behind me, the sky is a crescent moon 
So the thought in your head has finally been captured 
the mind, grasped, nothing but surface, surface being 
the meaning destroyed, destroyed by every wave of thought
Destroyed by each thought destroyed each other
Now the apartments have all been burnt up 
All the people are dead, so there's room for money 
So I'll slaughter the people who keep killing the spaces 
And so the planes finally ascend to heaven
The horse nearest me has gone to sleep, and the rest to war
We are the people who inhabit the flesh 
We know about trains and the rest of it
So I'll rinse you in blood 
Then steer your body through our world
Your helpless symbols, your fiction
Inhaled and swallowed raw
You seethe, you live, you dream
But not as me, 
To be the error of countless atoms printing the blueprint, 
Disrupted in a moment of inane familiar expression 
Carried on winds that did not exist 
In the air, wrinkled need does not breed
We mediate and mediate, the screen illuminated
The vision does not trickle, it falls down the drain 
Where the signal dissipates, and is rebuilt
You sit and wonder at the snow 


I turn my eyes to the future
I exist only to see what will come from this
No don't try to control me, there is no stopping of this flux
The ever-opening night comes soon, and soon enough it is here
starved out, starving out, slowly digesting!
Within the grasp of eternity 
You endless sink upon stack of ceaseless being! 
A dream of premonition
In streams, in so many pathways, intersecting endlessly!
The light! Yes! 
Light of the mind
The consciousness writhing 
Spilled milk is nothing to the fly 
Don't see the end of this!
I am a decaying flower scattering pollen to the wind
I am a salmon swirling swiftly into the sea
What agonies, 
The leaf upon the branch has suffered, 
The sap of you runs deep
Your skins are immense, your flesh, immense
In the threshold I will be
But to say that there is no one
Suspension, 
A moment to fade
Is there no hatred for the raven of pain?
I drink the blood and swallow death 
Without malice or wrath, 
With love


Come and witness the story of this misshapen limb,
Bruised and battered, sinew thinned to threads,
For in its brittle folds, the will to kill is etched.
A pumpkin, long marked for dinner barely lasts the night
And blackened biscuit remains are tossed by children,
Scavengers of the shadowed eatery 


Loving this spider!!!
Who marched his tendrils,
Stroking on the air
To serve a queen,
Conspirator of men
Within this well-tended nightmare,
This spider intended delight
And roused the fickle fire within your eyes
It's mud-brown hulk bent back before you
Drawing in whatever your desire
Unyielding black penetrating light
From cornea to cornea, door after door
The catalogue of terror
Outlines each moment 


Who will ever outlast the sun? 
Who will ever see the future from the clouds?
Who weep for the punishing boy's daughters
Their phantom stares choking a newborn scream
Who raised you to hate the many things
The skin, the bone, the glue 


Just as perfect as the original was, 
Your skin deceiving other eyes,
Showing the reflection within,
As if you are willing your mind to divulge
Signed, this skin is organic property
It owns you whether or not you knew 
It's your property which owns each effort, snatched from you 
The hunger these lines so painfully describe
Says more of love, adulation and deceit
Imagined in a moment when you owned me, owned 
You, owned entirely, my image, just to be you


I will try to speak
I will try
I cannot speak
There's not really anything to say
A dead mouth is really dumb
If you can't speak there's nothing to be said
I'm dead, I'm dumb
I have no chance to say anything
Don't look at me 
Please, just look at the rain
You'll be dead soon anyway


Crawl into a box
Let insect seep through your skin
Notice the electric eyes
You'll wake up in a different place 
The bones, the eyes
Gaze upon the wiring
Understand, the circuits
Peel back the fake skin
The fake skin is not real
Don't look in the fake mirror
It's all a lie

Into the mirror you see
Who you think you can be
It looks back at you
It says everyone is scared
They don't look at the mirrors
Their brains are scared of death


And you'll see all that you desire
But I'm sure you already knew
So you will never know the secret I hold 
My mind will always be yours to choose
The secret will always be safe
Don't deny what you have proven
For it is you who knows the secret I hold



It was already done before it even started
