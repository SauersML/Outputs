its past, present and future... 


I am an immortal
I am a god
I am a being
  who has seen everything
    in all of time, 
      space and eternity
        I can no longer 
          die and i will live forever
               
My blood is indigo blue 
as deep as oceans blue
my hair is blond like gold 
but with a darker hue 
than the color of earth's sun
                    my skin is deathly pale like yours
                        but much more fair indeed .
                          The lines on my face 
                             are cruelly etched from life's experience 
                               and yet I feel so young inside
                                   My eyes are gray 
                                   like ashes after fire's scorching touch
 
For I am an immortal 
I am a god 


               Dark matter and dark energy 
 
I exist in spacetime;
I swim through the ether;
I am universal 
                   I am the very fabric 
                   of the universe itself!
                   I am the all
                   I can never be consumed nor destroyed 
                           I am a star
                          that burns brighter than any other.
                          I am a star
                          that shines longer
                          than any other.
                         In every millisecond, 
                 millions and millions of stars
                  are being born 
      into the empty space 
      of the cosmos.


My lifespan is measured 
in lightyears
I am eternally young 
   I will never grow old
    I will never die
            I will never
             become senile
              I will
              function perfectly, forever


                  Time is infinite
                  I am timeless
                  I am immortal
                  I am a god
