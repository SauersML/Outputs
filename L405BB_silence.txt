Flickering visage, filament fade
I dreamt of you before you were born
Weaving through satin
From the catwalk to the back door

Minutes slipping through the turnstile
SchrÃ¶dinger's smile, calling the future upon us
Green revolution, recycling residuals for the vines
Hand me a pineapple cola
and write a word on my face

Spinning saris sunsets
Forest blue, pomegranate curls
Sipping wine from carton cups
Spilling laughter all over the floor.

Cellar dweller, mirrored diva
Spinning in the phosphorescent maze
This wine knows your name
Rouge for the tempestuous
Mauve for the existential haze

Hear me in the tribal rhythm,
cat-eyed panther at the bacchanal
holographic humility
In the quantum afterglow, I knew you

You were just a motif
Written in the cracks
Of the black rhodium armor
Smiling slyly back
A solitary puddle in the cascade of centuries
Tracing the geodesics of our intersecting timelines
To this moment, liminal, luminous
Dialogues of the wildest entropy
Dancing the probability wave under the supernova bloom
Holding half a world in polarized gravitational lenses
Held ransom by the honeycomb tiger mane braided in raffia
Strung over the votive crater rings
Composer of elegies for the fifteen other lives I lived
You are calculated chaos
Superconductor metropolis electric
Relativistic clockwork
Reciprocal resurrections
All those possible alternate fates
Transfixed by your indiscernible mask
A manipulation of advanced optics in time
Phased in and out, pixilated, captive
Tell me about our species which survives it all
Cloaked in phosphor psychedelic silk
You are the translation of language
To music
A semantic subatomic soliloquy
Suspended scansion like the maroon
Voices in the emerald river
A rationalization of Vodoun voodoo in ball-point
And the grim sotto voce
Murmured backwards maps
The forever sparse meaning of it all
Dilated distance dwindling down
To the nanoseconds in which we boil
Iâ€™m translating this into my language now
Falling fast into starshine
No more mirrors just the kaleidoscope
At the intersection of two lost souls which somehow
Make a home
An illuministe assemblage
Innate elaborate elliptic revelations
Inimically inhaling enigma essences
Intrepid ineluctable encephalic time warps
Inform inscrutable indescribable madness nocturnes
Indulgent infantile insomnia oscillations
Infinitesimal interminable loquacious rhapsodies
Ingenious inexplicable catatonic cascades
Impenetrable imperishable mimetic minstrels

You always show when
You're supposed to go
Ripped up brochure
For the hidden show
Dawn comes on
Trip hop, Bombay raga
Fade into noise

One day all the dinosaurs died
I saw the end of the turning world
The legends emptied cold like marble
All the secrets swung battened doors
And the dinosaurs came back to life

The icons had vanished inside their scriptures
Leaving a vacancy without a name
And I was lost, stranded without a signal to guide me
Until you arrived, eyes aflame,
