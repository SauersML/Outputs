The forest is quiet.

You may hear no rustling of leaves nor song of birds upon their branches. A stillness beyond words falls upon me as my thoughts drift outward toward tender whispers only wind can carry. The slipstream dances around these skyscrapers â€“ unfelt, unseen. We become as mist brushing upon them in passing, forgotten
even before forgotten.
