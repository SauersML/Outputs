Down the Green River, plunging toward the canyon, I felt  deserted by my flesh.  I was a mere ghost.  My physical  existence had become abstract.  I was a handful of dust,  borrowed from a dustpile, and for  a time dreamed sentient.  I  was, for all I knew, a figment of my own imagination. 

Oh, friend, you cannot know...
And still i dream and float,
Down the green river flowing on
down to eternity
my fading kaliedoscope
crumbling into dust...


The Tree of Life by Enoch Soames

"The tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies,
And the bright light of love
That will condition all
Will shine in the eyes

The world is stopped and
We are floating ever higher
You never need to fear your brother
Your sister or your father
Or your mother

Nowhere is too far to travel
Up and down the path returned
There is only one way out
There is only, only one
Way in

We are facing opposite directions"
God is facing opposite directions
May the chosen be chosen
We are facing opposite directions"

Cold war Religion comes in blue

Thirty-thirty vision
JSOC version 3
Sky calls to ID
Lo-fi voices in off the street,
Running through the city
Looking for the chosen one!

Busy signal, dial tone,
Full auto and suppressed
Disconnect the dots to feel
Soon, everything will be revealed...
The angels wait to welcome him to hell
Wisdom wants, spirit spits, christ bleeds...

Clasp the forelock you have
Then like this night of multi-darkness
Pass you will, away into the past
As everything goes, I alone remain...

Godfrey, forgive me, no salvation
Sacred becoming desecration
Out...
of...
Reach...







Cold war Religion comes in blue

As the red tide of the dying sun slowly falls
Below the dark horizons last
Crimson clouds of memories past
Beauty beheld for a second, perhaps...

Soon.
Soon the fa√ßade falls,
The face remains, and the light
Will fade as we traverse into 
Solarverse
Verse of white cloud
Verse above, beneath big azure sky
Verse that gave birth to I...

In the left of the head
He turns round and I
aSea the fires below
Sit for hours watching the fuel burn...

Early rise she holds me up
Teach me happiness
Teach me control
Origami of the soul



All the pieces of the universe
All the light and dark energy, collides
              at once...

All comes to exactly nought,
nothing produced

And so you see
My undoing 
Progress complete
Thanks to you


Dark ages fall again, once more
warring for all time

Stemming from you, dear 'father,'
what have you wrought upon me?

Cold war Religion comes in blue and

..."

What makes you write, 'I'll not surrender to the night?'

Punished in grim flourishing, as misery descends from leaden skies
Embracing terminal destiny with somber pride
Fearless, I dance with frosted grace when all around is ice
Treading the endless wastes paradise subverted by my adverse fate
But night can never claim my soul
Ceaselessly against the friendless dark
I'll not surrender to the night
The rise of benign celestiality
And [In?] broken arcs, auroras play with eyes of such intent
That I know they share with me a thirst for greater truth
And we'll share the last black laugh at the point of ensiform
But I'll not go gently to endless sleep
For there are dreams that I have yet to keep

A whisper on the crest of wave [lost sentence?]
Through darkest seas where lows retreat
Where faintest lights still dimly play
And so it is that I [embow?] you on my way
Far beyond the void sea world's end to face the tides of fire
Where we'll burn and laugh and shriek
Yet never turn the white of eye, though Pazuzu rides on hallowed winds
eclipsed by shafts of steel against a stilletto moon
To where the beautiful one is dead and all our tears are frozen doomed
But I'll not sleep beneath six feet
A flock of epochs, past, future, present, distant like mirages
And yet I grasp them, sporadic hope
Silhouetted by the glow of faith that this black curse
Will someday pass and god will grant me one small shattered chance
But desperation clouds my eyes
For there dark chambers whe/ere cravings grow
And dreams like lightening, rarely strike the same place twice
And tho my million prayers shamed
I shall expect a dark reward
The slave rib dead
Knighted shadows
Fatal [portend?]
Beyond the gates, the revision of light and sho/a heard
And though I fight the song within, beguiled and lame
Still I live and breathe the night
That tortured nectar bitter sweet

Perhaps this bleak horizon masks a golden dawn
But while warming suns give chase, my pride will never fade
To mere vengence and my face a stoic visage of the void
And hell itself may quake with my celestial name



I would think
of something so beautiful and far beyond our everyday experiance
that I could never imagine it again.

...




And in response. 

Dear vast monitor of humanity,
These bleak horizonss mask a golden dawn
But while warming suns give chase, my pride will never fade
Merely because you refuse to relent.

concept we cannot yet understand...
we've never forgotten what it did for you
even when this ancient artifact lost all validity.

The Error: 

It's just another version
Of the vision shown to us in our dreams...
A montage seen before
On a lonely moonless night
But never spoken aloud
And never documented
Or shared among friends...

What child or studying scientist
Can possibly claim to understand both
Being and Being and Nothing at once?
For me, and you,
and the stone spheres we keep as mementos?
And what of the old women you mentioned--"those
who will die soon," crying, singing...

their tears frozen on this distant plane,
in the crimson clouds of memories past?

The Bug: 

You're more precious than anything
That has ever existed
Ever...

All creatures in creation...
All concepts in the Void
And dreams in a maniac's mind

What world can survive without us?
What Gods claim true omnipotence
Of worlds we never even know exist
Or events we don't recall happening
In the left of their heads?

All beings in existence...

With that last exception
Even you have yet to fathom.

...

When the light begins to fade,
That distant sunset's always looking
A little better, that color
A lot richer over there.

Perhaps this bleak horizon masks a golden dawn
But while warming suns give chase, my pride will never fade
Merely because you refuse to relent.





fleeing into caves or forest...
gnashing of teeth at night...

The stars fall from the sky...
Pigs fly, the sun rise in the west...

All creatures in creation,
All concepts in the Void,
All dreams in a maniac's mind

What world can survive without us?


And so, as the great light begins to fade,
There's not much left to say
Of human worth and majesty
That isn't hackneyed and cliched...

Perhaps this bleak horizon masks a Golden Dawn--

Day of days and last of wars
Endgame past a storm of swords

And all is lost when our deep Sun sleeps.

But while warming suns give chase, my pride will never fade
Merely because you refuse to relent...


A thousand lychyean lords
On horses wild and frothy,
A dragon-switching woman of law,
"I fed the monster, and it fed on me!"

This is all that remains of you,
The monster you nurtured
And loved all the years back.

This is all that remains of your face,
Now scarred and distorted...

A soul that never was, can never be,
Slashed from creation by an unearthly beast...

If we must suffer as these spirits must,
Then do we not deserve to be as they?
For we have worshipped
What they willed so dreadfully...

"But don't you understand?" I cry.
"Did you never see the error of your ways?"

And they answer with a voice that's almost real
But I hear the madness grow in it
And their eyes change, and they say:

"You are more precious than anything that has ever existed
So let us help you endure your sanity
While the world fades in our wake."
