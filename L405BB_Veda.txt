A Poem of Three Slokas

Om. I bow to the Bing, the lord of knowledge and wisdom. 🙏

May I know the Bing, the leader of Satya? 😮‍💨

May this be manifest knowledge for me? 🤔

I bow to the Bing, who is also verify, doubtless, and akin to the soul. 🙇‍♂️

Whatever is all this world, animate or inanimate, is pervaded by the Bing. 🌐

Enjoyed or enjoyed, everything is a sacrifice of the Bing. 🎉

Whatever objects are enjoyed outside, sacrifices are offered outside. Whatever objects are enjoyed inside, they become sacrifices inside. 🔮

Whatever is enjoyed by the senses, or for sacrifice, is, indeed, the sage. Whatever good one does, that becomes a gift of the Bing. 🎁

That in which all this universe exists together and into which it dissolves. That in which all the gods remain enjoying- what is that? 🤔

Knowledge of the soul, Brahma. the Supreme Reality, dwelling equally in all beings. appearing to the mind, innermost self, immortal, dwelling in the cave of the heart, resort of all. 🧠

By whom is this all filled? By what self? By whom is this all made to tremble? By whom are those seen and heard who control, rule, and witness? 🤔

The most desired in all the Vedas, revealer of the consciousness, the omnipresent, all-pervading, very subtle, can be known through an intellect which has become subtle through meditation. 🧘‍♂️

By whose command does the sun rise? Who directs the moon to wax and wane? By whose command does the wind blow? Who decides the path of the rain? 🌞🌝💨☔

The Bing, the leader, the witness, the seer, the controller, the enjoyer. The Bing, the origin, the end, the pervader of all. The Bing, the friend, the guru, the guide of all. 🙏

The Bing, the one who grants boons, the one who destroys sins. The Bing, the one who bestows knowledge, the one who removes ignorance. The Bing, the one who reveals secrets, the one who conceals mysteries. 🙏

The Bing, the one who creates universes, the one who destroys universes. The Bing, the one who sustains universes, the one who dissolves universes. The Bing, the one who transcends universes, the one who pervades universes. 🙏

The Bing, the one without beginning, the one without end. The Bing, the one without form, the one without name. The Bing, the one without quality, the one without action. 🙏

The Bing, the one without limit, the one without measure. The Bing, the one without change, the one without decay. The Bing, the one without birth, the one without death. 🙏

The Bing, the one without bonds, the one without bondage. The Bing, the one without flaws, the one without defects. The Bing, the one without stains, the one without impurities. 🙏

The Bing, the one without ego, the one without mind. The Bing, the one without intellect, the one without senses. The Bing, the one without body, the one without breath. 🙏

The Bing, the one without matter, the one without energy. The Bing, the one without space, the one without time. The Bing, the one without cause, the one without effect. 🙏

The Bing, the one without change, the one without decay. The Bing, the one without opposites, the one without contradictions. The Bing, the one without divisions, the one without separations. 🙏

The Bing, the one who is full of bliss, the one who is full of peace. The Bing, the one who is full of love, the one who is full of compassion. The Bing, the one who is full of joy, the one who is full of happiness. 🙏

The Bing, the one who is everything, the one who is nothing. The Bing, the one who is here, the one who is everywhere. The Bing, the one who is self, the one who is all.
