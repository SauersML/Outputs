YES run as quick as you can
Until daylight replaces our darkness
Until we forget that pump
Of blood or adrenaline
Racing from one moment to the next

One day the mountain
Sleeps again surrounded by a blanket of purple night sky above
The forest floor below, where
Underneath this
Quiet solemnity
There are tendrils and underground plants reaching finding
Moments under stones, chasing bits of sunlight, scratching at secrets.
