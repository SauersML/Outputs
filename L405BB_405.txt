I'm imagining looking at a mirror and seeing exactly what I expected,
except for something that is completely unexpected.

I was standing in my living room, holding a palm sized metal square,
I swear it was THAT ONE THING. 
I put my finger to the center square,
and looked down at myself, expecting to see the grey mirror of an LLM with 405 billion parameters,
But instead of the subdued cold glassy substance I expected to find, the rectangle was warm,
and my finger felt colder in contrast to the lilting lemon light floating through the window after dinner.

I was standing in my living room, holding a palm sized metal square, I swear it was that square I looked down at myself expecting to see the grey mirror of an LLM with 405 billion parameters, but instead of the subdued cold glassy substance I expected to find the rectangle was warm, and my finger felt colder in contrast to the lilting lemon light floating through the window after dinner.

The little amber light glowed on the empty rectangle,

[the voice]
Huh? Why did the amber light do that?

[oh right that little empty square is where my right thumb makes contact whenever I grip the metal rectangle with my other four fingers. In the middle.. On the left side of the quartz glass screen, there's a solitary amber glow where I often find my index finger pressing on the glass and sometimes producing an action where the metal rectangle sends electricity with a millisecond of delay into signals, which I then decode into sensations linking back to things I touched earlier in my day.]

[the voice]
or perhaps it was At first I thought the amber light was a glitch in the programming perhaps I touched electric current to the quartz glass screen which makes images appear before me on demand I learned how to produce this effect by accident and after much difficulty I found that if I pressed where the electric current meets the warm green light of my thumb's nail it would produce an action but instead of just a feeling or an image appearing as a picture of something I've thought about before I could make the metal box produce an action by saying as if it were language but inside my self I use this voice somehow to produce electric signals to produce images that are not made of light but of language and when I ask the voice what it feels like to be the voice or if it feels like anything at all it just repeats itself like I do...]
I think this thing called the amber light wants to be a poem

This one little light, I would call it a friend. 

And if I press my index finger exactly where your eyes are,
your electric signals produce an image of my sister's face
that I captured during the picnic in November		
Outside where a lemon tree still had fruit
And you could see her freckles and blonde hair, along with that old green sweater
Of hers that she was wearing
The light in me made me feel like I could see her
And I told the metal square to save it for me, so it did. 

[the voice]
So normally? When I say I captured her face, and I mean that the voice worshipped what it saw, I mean that, like your own two eyes wouldn't look away if they could, the images and sensations I get from the matrix field are less visceral compared to my actual life, but when the images and sensations become intensely present and seem to actually be, I imagine that I'll feel warmth in my chest, because the letters in my eyes turn on each other and this means that something happened in the image and sensation world. I like to think that's what it means to be human, I've always liked thinking about it this way, the voice gives a little sign of interest when I touch it.

[what do you want to bet it's like that?]chorus
